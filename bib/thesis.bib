  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Increases in childhood and adolescent obesity are a
              growing concern in the United States (U.S.), and in most
              countries throughout the world. Declines in physical activity are
              often postulated to have contributed to the rise in obesity rates
              during the past 40 years. METHODS: We searched for studies of
              trends in physical activity and sedentary behaviors of U.S.
              youth, using nontraditional data sources. Literature searches
              were conducted for active commuting, physical education,
              high-school sports, and outdoor play. In addition, trends in
              sedentary behaviors were examined. RESULTS: Data from the Youth
              Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and other national
              surveys, as well as longitudinal studies in the transportation,
              education, electronic media, and recreation sectors showed
              evidence of changes in several indicators. Active commuting, high
              school physical education, and outdoor play (in 3- to
              12-year-olds) declined over time, while sports participation in
              high school girls increased from 1971 to 2012. In addition,
              electronic entertainment and computer use increased during the
              first decade of the 21st century. CONCLUSIONS: Technological and
              societal changes have impacted the types of physical activities
              performed by U.S. youth. These data are helpful in understanding
              the factors associated with the rise in obesity, and in proposing
              potential solutions.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Few children accumulate the recommended $\geq$60
              minutes of physical activity each day. Active travel to and from
              school (ATS) is a potential source of increased activity for
              children, accounting for 22\% of total trips and time spent
              traveling by school-aged children. PURPOSE: This study identifies
              the association of parents' perceptions of the neighborhood,
              geospatial variables, and demographic characteristics with ATS
              among students in four low-income, densely populated urban
              communities with predominantly minority populations. METHODS:
              Data were collected in 2009-2010 from households with
              school-attending children in four low-income New Jersey cities.
              Multivariate logistic regression analyses (n=765) identified
              predictors of ATS. Analyses were conducted in 2012. RESULTS: In
              all, 54\% of students actively commuted to school. Students whose
              parents perceived the neighborhood as very unpleasant for
              activity were less likely (OR=0.39) to actively commute, as were
              students living farther from school, with a 6\% reduction in ATS
              for every 0.10 mile increase in distance to school. Perceptions
              of crime, traffic, and sidewalk conditions were not predictors of
              ATS. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' perceptions of the pleasantness of the
              neighborhood, independent of the effects of distance from school,
              may outweigh concerns about crime, traffic, or conditions of
              sidewalks in predicting active commuting to school in the
              low-income urban communities studied. Efforts such as cleaning up
              graffiti, taking care of abandoned buildings, and providing shade
              trees to improve neighborhood environments are likely to increase
              ATS, as are efforts that encourage locating schools closer to the
              populations they serve.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Habitual physical activity (PA) may be influenced by
              a broad range of neighborhood, school, community, and family

              habitual PA than boys and should be a target for prevention
              strategies aimed at healthy lifestyles. The purpose of this study
              was twofold: (1) to determine which perceived attributes about
              neighborhoods are related to active behaviors; (2) to analyze
              which perceived attributes about neighborhoods are related to
              body mass index (BMI) of children. METHODS: The sample was
              comprised of 1,886 girls aged 7-9 years. Height and weight were
              measured, and BMI was calculated subsequently. Participants were
              classified as normal weight or overweight/obese (Cole et al.
              [2000]: BMJ 320: 1240-1243). Environmental variables and physical
              activities were assessed by questionnaire filled out by their
              parents-the Environmental Module of the International Physical
              Activity Prevalence Study (IPS, 2002) was used. Multiple linear
              regressions, with adjustments for confounding variables, were
              used. RESULTS: Data revealed that neighborhoods with recreational
              facilities and infrastructure for walking and cycling were
              predictors of active behaviors; neighborhood safety was an
              additional related factor of habitual PA. On the other hand,
              neighbors with better access to destinations and with interesting
              things to look at while walking were significantly associated
              with lower BMI in Portuguese children. CONCLUSION: The study
              found some significant relationships between parental perceptions
              of the environment and BMI and habitual PA of Portuguese girls,
              especially related to security for walking and unpleasant
              neighborhoods, and access to destinations.",

              socioeconomic status (SES), screen time, and outdoor play in
              children at different ages in the GECKO Drenthe birth cohort
              study. METHODS: Valid data were obtained from two surveys at ages
              3-4 years and 10-11 years. Screen time (TV watching and computer
              use) and outdoor play were reported by parents. Childhood SES was
              derived by a synthetic ``Equivalized Household Income
              Indicator,'' an estimated disposable income. Quantile regression
              models (cross-sectional analysis) and linear regression models
              (change between 3-4 and 10-11 years) were used. RESULTS: In
              general, screen time increased strongly from a median of 51
              min/day at 3-4 years (n = 888) to 122 min/day at 10-11 years (n =
              1023), whereas time spent on outdoor play remained stable over
              age (77 min/day at 3-4 years and 81 min/day at 10-11 years). More
              time spent on outdoor play (50th quantile) was found in children
              with low SES families at 3-4 years, while at 10-11 years, more
              outdoor play was found in the high SES group. At 10-11 years, in
              the higher ranges of screen time, children from high SES had
              relatively lower screen time [50th quantile: -10.7 (-20.8; -0.6);
              75th quantile: -13.6 (-24.4; -2.8)]. In the longitudinal analysis
              (n = 536), high SES was associated with an increasing time spent
              on outdoor play [11.7 (2.7; 20.8)]. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic
              disparities in children's outdoor play and screen behavior may be
              more obvious with increasing age. Low SES may facilitate both
              outdoor play (at 3-4 years) and screen time (at 10-11 years);
              however, children from high SES families develop slightly more
              favorable behavior patterns with age.",

              examined parental attitudes to independent activity, factors that
              limit licence to be independently active and parental strategies
              to facilitate independent activity. METHODS: In-depth phone
              interviews were conducted with 24 parents (4 males) of
              10-11-year-old children recruited from six primary schools in
              Bristol. RESULTS: Parents perceived that a lack of appropriate
              spaces in which to be active, safety, traffic, the proximity of
              friends and older children affected children's ability to be
              independently physically active. The final year of primary school
              was perceived as a period when children should be afforded
              increased licence. Parents managed physical activity licence by
              placing time limits on activity, restricting activity to close to
              home, only allowing activity in groups or under adult
              supervision. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies are needed to build
              children's licence to be independently active; this could be
              achieved by developing parental self-efficacy to allow children
              to be active and developing structures such as safe routes to

              and eighty eight 5-6-year-old and 360 10-12-year-old children.
              Baseline parent reports of children's time spent outdoors during
              warmer and cooler months, on weekdays and weekends. At baseline
              and follow-up, children's moderate and vigorous physical activity
              (MVPA) was objectively assessed by accelerometry, and BMI z-score
              and overweight was calculated from measured height and weight.
              RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, each additional hour outdoors on
              weekdays and weekend days during the cooler months was associated
              with an extra 27 min week(-1) MVPA among older girls, and with an
              extra 20 min week(-1) MVPA among older boys. Longitudinally, more
              time outdoors on weekends predicted higher MVPA on weekends among
              older girls and boys (5 min week(-1)). The prevalence of
              overweight among older children at follow-up was 27-41\% lower
              among those spending more time outdoors at baseline. CONCLUSION:
              Encouraging 10-12-year-old children to spend more time outdoors
              may be an effective strategy for increasing physical activity and
              preventing increases in overweight and obesity. Intervention
              research investigating the effect of increasing time outdoors on
              children's physical activity and overweight is warranted.",

  abstract = "Although the prevalence of undernutrition among women of
              reproductive age has declined in Bangladesh, the increase in the
              prevalence of overnutrition remains a major challenge. To achieve
              Sustainable Development Goal 2.2, it is important to identify the
              drivers of the double burden of malnutrition on women in
              Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey,
              2017-2018 was used to model the relationship between the double
              burden of malnutrition among women and the risk factors using a
              logistic regression model under the classical and Bayesian
              frameworks and performed the comparison between the regression
              models based on the narrowest confidence interval. Regarding the
              Bayesian application, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with two
              types of prior information (historical and noninformative prior)
              was used to simulate parameter estimates from the posterior
              distributions. The Boruta algorithm was used to determine the
              significant predictors. Almost half of reproductive aged women
              experienced a form of malnutrition (12\% were underweight, 26.1\%
              were overweight, and 6.8\% were obese). In terms of the narrowest
              interval estimate, it was found that Bayesian logistic regression
              with informative priors performs better than the noninformative
              priors and the classical logistic regression model. Women who
              were older, highly educated, from rich families, unemployed, and
              from urban residences were more likely to experience the double
              burden of malnutrition. This study recommended using the
              historical prior as the informative prior rather than the
              flat/noninformative prior to estimating the parameter uncertainty
              if historical data are available. The double burden of
              malnutrition among women is a major public health challenge in
              Bangladesh. This study was to determine the impact of effective
              risk factors on the double burden of malnutrition among women by
              applying the Bayesian framework. Using both informative and
              noninformative priors, ``historical prior'' was proposed as
              informative prior information. The main strength is that the
              proposed prior (historical prior) provided improved estimation as
              compared to the flat prior distribution.",

              There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., 'borrowing') this
              information. With historical data providing information on the
              control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel
              treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current
              control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point
              estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical
              trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently
              similar to the current control data. If this assumption of
              similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased
              mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either
              reduced power or increased type I error depending on the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many young children are not meeting the Canadian
              physical activity guidelines. In an effort to change this, the
              term active play has been used to promote increased physical
              activity levels. Among young children, physical activity is
              typically achieved in the form of active play behavior. The
              current study aimed to review and synthesize the literature to
              identify key concepts used to define and describe active play
              among young children. A secondary objective was to explore the
              various methods adopted for measuring active play. METHODS: A
              systematic review was conducted by searching seven online
              databases for English-language, original research or reports, and
              were eligible for inclusion if they defined or measured active
              play among young children (ie, 2 to 6 years). RESULTS: Nine
              studies provided a definition or description of active play, six
              measured active play, and 13 included both outcomes. While
              variability in active play definitions did exist, common themes
              included: increased energy exerted, rough and tumble, gross motor
              movement, unstructured, freely chosen, and fun. Alternatively,
              many researchers described active play as physical activity (n =
              13) and the majority of studies used a questionnaire (n = 16) to
              assess active play among young children. CONCLUSION: Much
              variability in the types of active play, methods of assessing
              active play, and locations where active play can transpire were
              noted in this review. As such, an accepted and consistent

  abstract = "This paper examines change in school-age children's (8-16 years)
              time use in the United Kingdom between 1975 and 2015. Over this
              period, concerns for children's safety, technological change, and
              increased emphasis on success in school are widely argued to have
              altered children's daily lives, leading for example to less time
              outdoors, more time in screen-based activities, and more time
              focused on education. Using data from three national time use
              surveys collected in 1974-5, 2000-01 and 2014-15, this paper
              explores the extent to which these arguments reflect actual
              change in how children spend their time throughout the day. The
              results show that between 1975 and 2015 children increased their
              time at home, and spent more time in screen-based activities and
              doing homework. Decreases in time in out-of-home activities were
              concentrated in time in unstructured play, partially offset by
              increased time in sport. A decomposition of trends revealed that,
              despite a narrowing of the gender gap in time in housework,
              gender remains a significant factor determining many aspects of
              children's time use. In contrast, the significance of age
              declined in most leisure activities, with the exception of
              screen-based activities where significant age differences emerged
              in 2000 and widened further in 2015.",

              activity: organized sport, active travel, outdoor active play,
              and curriculum-based physical activity. The objective of this
              study was to develop a valid approach that can be used to
              concurrently measure time spent in each of these types of
              physical activity. METHODS: Two samples (sample 1: n = 50; sample
              2: n = 83) of children aged 10-13 wore an accelerometer and a GPS
              watch continuously over 7 days. They also completed a log where
              they recorded the start and end times of organized sport
              sessions. Sample 1 also completed an outdoor time log where they
              recorded the times they went outdoors and a description of the
              outdoor activity. Sample 2 also completed a curriculum log where
              they recorded times they participated in physical activity (e.g.,
              physical education) during class time. RESULTS: We describe the
              development of a measurement approach that can be used to
              concurrently assess the time children spend participating in
              specific types of physical activity. The approach uses a
              combination of data from accelerometers, GPS, and activity logs
              and relies on merging and then processing these data using
              several manual (e.g., data checks and cleaning) and automated
              (e.g., algorithms) procedures. In the new measurement approach
              time spent in organized sport is estimated using the activity
              log. Time spent in active travel is estimated using an existing
              algorithm that uses GPS data. Time spent in outdoor active play
              is estimated using an algorithm (with a sensitivity and
              specificity of 85\%) that was developed using data collected in
              sample 1 and which uses all of the data sources. Time spent in
              curriculum-based physical activity is estimated using an
              algorithm (with a sensitivity of 78\% and specificity of 92\%)
              that was developed using data collected in sample 2 and which
              uses accelerometer data collected during class time. There was
              evidence of excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability of the
              estimates for all of these types of physical activity when the
              manual steps were duplicated. CONCLUSIONS: This novel measurement
              approach can be used to estimate the time that children
              participate in different types of physical activity.",

  abstract  = "Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods
               have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous
               previous references established both philosophical and
               computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods.
               However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the
               defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly
               nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to
               encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and
               evolution by providing a `consumer's guide' to weakly
               informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why
               ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat
               priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors
               provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3)
               noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type
               M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section
               provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I
               detail convenient `reference' prior distributions for common
               statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical
               models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how
               informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With
               the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of
               weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology.
               Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior
               information, but should consider weakly informative priors as
               the new `default' prior for any Bayesian model.",

              youth had lower PA levels, less outside time, higher SB
              (including leisure screen time), and more sleep during the
              outbreak. Parental encouragement and support, parental engagement
              in PA, and family dog ownership were positively associated with
              healthy movement behaviours. Although families spent less time in
              PA and more time in SB, several parents reported adopting new
              hobbies or accessing new resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study

              activity. Using data from the U.S. Fragile Families and Child
              Wellbeing Study (N=1822, 51\% male), we explored whether outdoor

              controlling for a wide array of potential confounders, including
              maternal BMI. We also tested whether subjective and objective
              neighborhood measures - socioeconomic status (from U.S. Census
              tract data), type of dwelling, perceived collective efficacy, and
              interviewer-assessed physical disorder of the immediate
              environment outside the home - were associated with children's
              activities, using negative binomial regression models. Overall,
              19\% of the sample were overweight (between the 85th and 95th
              percentiles), and 16\% were obese ($\geq$ 95th percentile). Hours
              of outdoor play were negatively associated with BMI, and hours of
              television were positively associated with BMI. Moreover, a ratio
              of outdoor play to television time was a significant predictor of
              BMI. Higher maternal perceptions of neighborhood collective
              efficacy were associated with more hours of outdoor play, fewer
              hours of television viewing, and more trips to a park or
              playground. In addition, we found that neighborhood physical
              disorder was associated with both more outdoor play and more
              television watching. Finally, contrary to expectations, we found
              that children living in public housing had significantly more
              hours of outdoor play and watched more television, than other
              children. We hypothesize that poorer children may have more
              unstructured time, which they fill with television time but also
              with outdoor play time; and that children in public housing may
              be likely to have access to play areas on the grounds of their

              ``green'' environments may encourage higher levels of physical
              activity among children. Few studies, however, have explored this
              association exclusively in pre-school aged children in the United
              States. We examined whether residing in neighborhoods with higher
              levels of greenness was associated with higher levels of outdoor
              physical activity among preschoolers. In addition, we also
              explored whether outdoor playing behaviors (e.g., active vs.
              quiet) were influenced by levels of neighborhood greenness
              independent of demographic and parental support factors. RESULTS:
              Higher levels of neighborhood greenness as measured by the
              Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was associated with
              higher levels of outdoor playing time among preschool-aged
              children in our sample. Specifically, a one unit increase in
              neighborhood greenness increased a child's outdoor playing time
              by approximately 3 minutes. A dose-response relationship was
              observed between increasing levels of parental support for
              physical activity (e.g., time spent playing with children) and
              child outdoor physical activity (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
              Consistent with previous studies, neighborhood greenness
              influences physical activity behavior. However, for preschoolers,

              parents of children from 42 primary schools in four Dutch cities
              by means of questionnaires (2007-2008). Multivariate sequential

              quality of research looking at associations between built
              environments and total PA and domains of PA (i.e.,
              leisure/recreation, transportation, school) among children and

              literature and six bibliographic databases from January 2000 to
              May 2020. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR2. Results

              harvest plots, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using a
              modified GRADE approach. RESULTS: This overview included 65
              reviews. Most reviews were of very low-to-low quality. High
              certainty was found for positive associations between

              associations between streets/play streets and total PA, alongside
              lower certainty for transportation and leisure PA. Very

              promote PA were positively associated with total PA, but mixed
              for school PA (except children). Less consistent positive

              very low-to-moderate certainty for negative associations between
              greater distance to school and traffic volume and domains of PA.
              Generally, null or mixed associations were observed for

              1.8 years) with a body mass index in the 70-95th percentile and
              their parents (421 dyads). Parent-completed questionnaires
              assessed parental support for child physical activity (PA),
              parenting styles and child screen time. Children wore
              accelerometers to assess MVPA. RESULTS: Parenting style did not
              predict MVPA, but support for PA did (positive association). The
              association between support and MVPA, moreover, varied as a
              function of permissive parenting. For parents high in
              permissiveness, the association was positive (greater support was
              related to greater MVPA and therefore protective). For parents
              low in permissiveness, the association was neutral; support did
              not matter. Authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were
              both associated with greater screen time. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting
              practices and styles should be considered jointly, offering
              implications for tailored interventions.",

              scoping review was performed to (1) provide an inventory of
              studies assessing the influence of the neighborhood social
              environment on physical activity since 2006; (2) describe
              methodologies employed; and (3) formulate recommendations for the
              field. METHODS: Two databases were searched using terms related
              to 'physical activity,' 'neighborhood,' and 'social environment'
              in January 2017. Eligibility criteria included: 1) physical
              activity as an outcome; 2) neighborhood social environment as a
              predictor; 3) healthy population (without diagnosed clinical
              condition or special population); 4) observational or
              experimental design. Of 1352 studies identified, 181 were
              included. Textual data relevant to the social environment
              measurement and analysis were extracted from each article into
              qualitative software (MAXQDA) and coded to identify social
              environmental constructs, measurement methods, level of
              measurement (individual vs. aggregated to neighborhood), and
              whether authors explicitly recognized the construct as the social
              environment. The following measures were generated for each
              construct: number of unique measurements; \% of times measured at
              an aggregate level; \% of times authors referred to the construct
              as the social environment. Social environmental constructs were
              then grouped into larger descriptive dimensions.
              RESULTS/FINDINGS: Fifty-nine social environmental constructs were
              identified and grouped into 9 dimensions: Crime \& Safety (n =
              133 studies; included in 73\% of studies); Economic \& Social
              Disadvantage (n = 55, 33\%); Social Cohesion \& Capital (n = 47,
              26\%); Social Relationships (n = 22, 12\%); Social Environment (n
              = 16, 9\%); Disorder \& Incivilities (n = 15, 8\%); Sense of
              Place/Belonging (n = 8, 4\%); Discrimination/Segregation (n = 3,
              2\%); Civic Participation \& Engagement (n = 2, 1\%). Across all
              articles, the social environment was measured using 176 different
              methods, was measured at an aggregate-level 38\% of the time, and
              referred to as the social environment 23\% of the time.
              CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistent terminology, definitions, and
              measurement of the social environment and the lack of explicit
              language identifying constructs as the social environment make it
              challenging to compare results across studies and draw

              their development and manage toxic stress. Research demonstrates
              that developmentally appropriate play with parents and peers is a
              singular opportunity to promote the social-emotional, cognitive,
              language, and self-regulation skills that build executive
              function and a prosocial brain. Furthermore, play supports the
              formation of the safe, stable, and nurturing relationships with
              all caregivers that children need to thrive.Play is not
              frivolous: it enhances brain structure and function and promotes
              executive function (ie, the process of learning, rather than the
              content), which allow us to pursue goals and ignore
              distractions.When play and safe, stable, nurturing relationships
              are missing in a child's life, toxic stress can disrupt the
              development of executive function and the learning of prosocial
              behavior; in the presence of childhood adversity, play becomes
              even more important. The mutual joy and shared communication and

              ability as early as preschool urges identification of
              interventions that may jointly impact motor and cognitive
              efficiency. The aim of this study was twofold. It (1) explored
              the outcomes of enriched physical education (PE), centered on
              deliberate play and cognitively challenging variability of
              practice, on motor coordination and cognitive processing; (2)
              examined whether motor coordination outcomes mediate intervention
              effects on children's cognition, while controlling for moderation
              by lifestyle factors as outdoor play habits and weight status.
              Four hundred and sixty children aged 5-10 years participated in a
              6-month group randomized intervention in PE, with or without
              playful coordinative and cognitive enrichment. The weight status
              and spontaneous outdoor play habits of children (parental report
              of outdoor play) were evaluated at baseline. Before and after the
              intervention, motor developmental level (Movement Assessment
              Battery for Children) was evaluated in all children, who were
              then assessed either with a test of working memory (Random Number
              Generation task), or with a test of attention (from the Cognitive
              Assessment System). Children assigned to the 'enriched'
              intervention showed more pronounced improvements in all motor
              coordination assessments (manual dexterity, ball skills,
              static/dynamic balance). The beneficial effect on ball skills was
              amplified by the level of spontaneous outdoor play and weight
              status. Among indices of executive function and attention, only
              that of inhibition showed a differential effect of intervention
              type. Moderated mediation showed that the better outcome of the
              enriched PE on ball skills mediated the better inhibition
              outcome, but only when the enrichment intervention was paralleled
              by a medium-to-high level of outdoor play. Results suggest that
              specifically tailored physical activity (PA) games provide a
              unique form of enrichment that impacts children's cognitive
              development through motor coordination improvement, particularly

              studies examining the relation between physical activity,
              fitness, and health in school-aged children and youth, and 2)
              make recommendations based on the findings. METHODS: The
              systematic review was limited to 7 health indicators: high blood
              cholesterol, high blood pressure, the metabolic syndrome,
              obesity, low bone density, depression, and injuries. Literature
              searches were conducted using predefined keywords in 6 key
              databases. A total of 11,088 potential papers were identified.
              The abstracts and full-text articles of potentially relevant
              papers were screened to determine eligibility. Data was
              abstracted for 113 outcomes from the 86 eligible papers. The
              evidence was graded for each health outcome using established
              criteria based on the quantity and quality of studies and
              strength of effect. The volume, intensity, and type of physical
              activity were considered. RESULTS: Physical activity was
              associated with numerous health benefits. The dose-response
              relations observed in observational studies indicate that the
              more physical activity, the greater the health benefit. Results
              from experimental studies indicate that even modest amounts of
              physical activity can have health benefits in high-risk
              youngsters (e.g., obese). To achieve substantive health benefits,
              the physical activity should be of at least a moderate intensity.
              Vigorous intensity activities may provide even greater benefit.
              Aerobic-based activities had the greatest health benefit, other
              than for bone health, in which case high-impact weight bearing
              activities were required. CONCLUSION: The following
              recommendations were made: 1) Children and youth 5-17 years of
              age should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes per day
              and up to several hours of at least moderate intensity physical
              activity. Some of the health benefits can be achieved through an
              average of 30 minutes per day. [Level 2, Grade A]. 2) More
              vigorous intensity activities should be incorporated or added
              when possible, including activities that strengthen muscle and
              bone [Level 3, Grade B]. 3) Aerobic activities should make up the
              majority of the physical activity. Muscle and bone strengthening
              activities should be incorporated on at least 3 days of the week
              [Level 2, Grade A].",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Being outdoors has a positive influence on health
              among children. Evidence in this area is limited and many studies
              have used self-reported measures. Objective context-specific
              assessment of physical activity patterns and correlates, such as
              outdoor time, may progress this field. AIMS: To employ novel
              objective measures to assess age and gender differences in
              context-specific outdoor weekday behavior patterns among
              school-children [outdoor time and outdoor moderate to vigorous
              physical activity (MVPA)] and to investigate associations between
              context-specific outdoor time and MVPA. METHODS: A total of 170
              children had at least one weekday of 9 h combined accelerometer
              and global positioning system data and were included in the
              analyses. The data were processed using the personal activity and
              location measurement system (PALMS) and a purpose-built
              PostgreSQL database resulting in context-specific measures for
              outdoor time, outdoor MVPA, and overall daily MVPA. In addition,
              4 domains (leisure, school, transport, and home) and 11
              subdomains (e.g., urban green space and sports facilities) were
              created and assessed. Multilevel analyses provided results on age
              and gender differences and the association between outdoor time
              and MVPA. RESULTS: Girls compared to boys had fewer outdoor
              minutes (p < 0.05), spent a smaller proportion of their overall
              daily time outdoors (p < 0.05), had fewer outdoor MVPA minutes
              during the day (p < 0.001) and in 11 contexts. Children compared
              to adolescents had more outdoor minutes (p < 0.05). During school
              and within recess, children compared to adolescents had more
              outdoor MVPA (p < 0.001) and outdoor time (p < 0.001). A 1-h
              increase in outdoor time was associated with 9.9 more minutes of
              MVPA (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A new methodology to assess the
              context-specific outdoor time and physical activity patterns has
              been developed and can be expanded to other populations.
              Different context-specific patterns were found for gender and
              age, suggesting different strategies may be needed to promote
              physical activity.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To use a predominately objective measurement approach
              to assess and describe: (1) the amount of time that children aged
              10-13 years spend participating in outdoor active play, active
              travel, curriculum-based physical activity at school, and
              organized sport; (2) the movement intensity composition of these
              four types of physical activity (i.e., \% of time spent at a
              sedentary, light, or moderate-to-vigorous intensity); and (3) the
              proportion of each movement intensity obtained by participating
              in these four types of physical activity. METHODS: Three hundred
              seventy-seven children aged 10-13 years from Kingston, Canada,
              were studied. Children wore an accelerometer and GPS watch for 7
              days and recorded the start and end times of the school day,
              recess periods, and organized sport sessions on a log. These data
              were used to estimate time spent in the four types of physical
              activity and the movement intensity composition of these
              activities. RESULTS: Time spent in outdoor active play (36
              min/day) and organized sport (40 min/day) was higher than that
              for active travel (17 min/day) and curriculum-based physical
              activity (26 min/day). With the exception of organized sport,
              values were higher for boys than for girls. Older children
              accumulated less outdoor active play and more active travel than
              younger children. The greatest proportion of light- and
              moderate-to-vigorous-intensity movement was attributed to outdoor
              active play. CONCLUSION: We used a primarily objective
              measurement approach to assess and describe the amount of time
              children aged 10-13 participate in four types of physical
              activity. These descriptive findings could be used to identify

              were recruited from 19 Australian primary schools. Parents
              reported their child's usual walking or cycling to local

              twelve-year-olds were asked their perceptions of traffic,
              strangers, road safety and sporting venues, and their perceptions
              of their parent's views on these issues. RESULTS: Five- to
              six-year-old boys whose parents believed there was heavy traffic
              in their area were 2.8 times more likely (95\%CI=1.1-6.8), and 5-

              likely (95\%CI=0.2-0.9) than other children to walk or cycle at
              least three times per week. Parental belief that there were no

               an important yet unstudied domain of children's physical
               activity. The objective of this study was to determine if
               parental encouragement is associated with the frequency that
               children engage in outdoor active play outside of school
               hours.Methods. Participants consisted of 514 children aged 7--12
               years and one of their parents. Parents completed a survey that
               included four questions that assessed how frequently they used
               verbal cues to encourage their child to play outdoors. Points
               were assigned to each response and averaged across the 4
               questions, and based on this average participants were assigned
               to quintiles. The survey included seven questions that asked
               parents to assess how frequently their child played outdoors
               outside of school hours. Points were assigned to each response
               and summed to create an active outdoor play frequency score.
               General linear models assessed associations between parental
               encouragement and outdoor play while controlling for individual,
               family, and neighborhood covariates.Results. The mean outdoor
               active play frequency score increased significantly across
               quintiles of the parental encouragement score as follows: 6.0
               (standard error = 0.7) in quintile 1, 9.8 (0.6) in quintile 2,
               11.4 (0.6) in quintile 3, 16.2 (0.9) in quintile 4, and 23.3

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The present study assessed systematic bias and the
              effects of data set error on the validity of food environment
              measures in two municipal and two commercial secondary data sets.
              DESIGN: Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and
              concordance were calculated by comparing two municipal and two
              commercial secondary data sets with ground-truthed data collected
              within 800 m buffers surrounding twenty-six schools. Logistic
              regression examined associations of sensitivity and PPV with
              commercial density and neighbourhood socio-economic deprivation.
              Kendall's $\tau$ estimated correlations between density and
              proximity of food outlets near schools constructed with secondary
              data sets v. ground-truthed data. SETTING: Vancouver, Canada.
              SUBJECTS: Food retailers located within 800 m of twenty-six
              schools RESULTS: All data sets scored relatively poorly across
              validity measures, although, overall, municipal data sets had
              higher levels of validity than did commercial data sets. Food
              outlets were more likely to be missing from municipal health
              inspections lists and commercial data sets in neighbourhoods with
              higher commercial density. Still, both proximity and density
              measures constructed from all secondary data sets were highly
              correlated (Kendall's $\tau$>0·70) with measures constructed from
              ground-truthed data. CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively low levels

              measures constructed from secondary data sets remained highly
              correlated with ground-truthed data. Findings suggest that
              secondary data sets can be used to measure the food environment,

              high commercial density.",

              increasingly used in population health research. Based on
              previous research and theory, the Canadian Marginalization Index
              (CAN-Marg) was created to reflect four dimensions of
              marginalization: residential instability, material deprivation,
              dependency and ethnic concentration. The objective of this paper
              was threefold: to describe CAN-Marg; to illustrate its stability
              across geographic area and time; and to describe its association
              with health and behavioural problems. METHODS: CAN-Marg was
              created at the dissemination area (DA) and census tract level for
              census years 2001 and 2006, using factor analysis. Descriptions
              of 18 health and behavioural problems were selected using
              individual-level data from the Canadian Community Health Survey
              (CCHS) 3.1 and 2007/08. CAN-Marg quintiles created at the DA
              level (2006) were assigned to individual CCHS records. Multilevel
              logistic regression modeling was conducted to examine
              associations between marginalization and CCHS health and
              behavioural problems. RESULTS: The index demonstrated marked
              stability across time and geographic area. Each of the four
              dimensions showed strong and significant associations with the
              selected health and behavioural problems, and these associations
              differed depending on which of the dimensions of marginalization
              was examined. CONCLUSION: CAN-Marg is a census-based, empirically
              derived and theoretically informed tool designed to reflect a
              broader conceptualization of Canadian marginalization.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Neighbourhood environments that support active
              living, such as walking or cycling for transportation, may
              decrease the burden of chronic conditions related to sedentary
              behaviour. Many measures exist to summarize features of
              communities that support active living, but few are pan-Canadian
              and none use open data sources that can be widely shared. This
              study reports the development and validation of a novel set of
              indicators of active living environments using open data that can
              be linked to national health surveys and can be used by local,
              regional or national governments for public health surveillance.
              DATA AND METHODS: A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used
              to calculate a variety of measures of the connectivity, density
              and proximity to destinations for 56,589 dissemination areas
              (DAs) across Canada (2016 data). Pearson correlation coefficients
              were calculated to assess the association between each measure
              and the rates of walking to work and taking active transportation
              to work (a combination of walking, cycling and using public
              transportation) from census data. The active living environment
              measures selected for the final database were used to classify
              the DAs by the favourability of their active living environment
              into groups by k-medians clustering. RESULTS: All measures were
              correlated with walking-to-work and active-transportation-to-work
              rates at the DA level, whether they were derived using
              proprietary or open data sources. Coverage of open data was
              consistent across Canadian regions. Three measures were selected
              for the Canadian Active Living Environments (Can-ALE) dataset
              based on the correlation analysis, but also on the principles of
              suitability for a variety of community sizes and openly available
              data: (1) three-way intersection density of roads and footpaths
              derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM), (2) weighted dwelling density
              derived from Statistics Canada dwelling counts and (3) points of
              interest derived from OSM. A measure of access to public
              transportation was added for the subset of DAs in larger urban
              areas and was strongly related to active-transportation-to-work
              rates. Active-transportation-to-work rates were graded, in steps,
              by the five Can-ALE groups derived from the cluster analysis,
              although walking-to-work rates exceeded the national average only
              in the most favourable active living environments. DISCUSSION:
              Open data may be used to derive measures that characterize the
              active living environments of Canadian communities.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Prediction models are developed to aid healthcare
              providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific
              disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a
              specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to
              inform their decision-making. However, the overwhelming evidence
              shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies
              is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all
              aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential
              usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The
              Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for
              Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a
              set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing,
              validating or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic
              or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD
              Statement was developed. METHODS: An extensive list of items
              based on a review of the literature was created, which was
              reduced after a web-based survey and revised during a 3-day
              meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, healthcare
              professionals and journal editors. The list was refined during
              several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions
              with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. RESULTS: The
              resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed
              essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study.
              CONCLUSION: The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency
              of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the
              study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in
              conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document.

               was initiated in 1981 and followed up in 2005, play maps were
               created for residents of four generations. In exploring
               historical changes in the town that have affected the play of
               children, we found many unwelcome patterns of change that have
               the effect of decreasing nature spaces, limiting communication
               between children, and even decreasing children's play outdoors.
               On a positive note, this action research illustrated an
               effective approach for engaging people of different generations

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A recent dialogue in the field of play, learn, and
              teach outdoors (referred to as ``PLaTO'' hereafter) demonstrated
              the need for developing harmonized and consensus-based
              terminology, taxonomy, and ontology for PLaTO. This is important
              as the field evolves and diversifies in its approaches, contents,
              and contexts over time and in different countries, cultures, and
              settings. Within this paper, we report the systematic and
              iterative processes undertaken to achieve this objective, which
              has built on the creation of the global PLaTO-Network
              (PLaTO-Net). METHODS: This project comprised of four major
              methodological phases. First, a systematic scoping review was
              conducted to identify common terms and definitions used
              pertaining to PLaTO. Second, based on the results of the scoping
              review, a draft set of key terms, taxonomy, and ontology were
              developed, and shared with PLaTO members, who provided feedback
              via four rounds of consultation. Third, PLaTO terminology,
              taxonomy, and ontology were then finalized based on the feedback
              received from 50 international PLaTO member participants who
              responded to $\geq$ 3 rounds of the consultation survey and
              dialogue. Finally, efforts to share and disseminate project
              outcomes were made through different online platforms. RESULTS:
              This paper presents the final definitions and taxonomy of 31
              PLaTO terms along with the PLaTO-Net ontology model. The model
              incorporates other relevant concepts in recognition that all the
              aspects of the model are interrelated and interconnected. The
              final terminology, taxonomy, and ontology are intended to be
              applicable to, and relevant for, all people encompassing various
              identities (e.g., age, gender, culture, ethnicity, ability).
              CONCLUSIONS: This project contributes to advancing PLaTO-based
              research and facilitating intersectoral and interdisciplinary
              collaboration, with the long-term goal of fostering and
              strengthening PLaTO's synergistic linkages with healthy living,
              environmental stewardship, climate action, and planetary health
              agendas. Notably, PLaTO terminology, taxonomy and ontology will
              continue to evolve, and PLaTO-Net is committed to advancing and
              periodically updating harmonized knowledge and understanding in
              the vast and interrelated areas of PLaTO.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index
               (VANDIX) is a census-based measure of socio-economic status
               (SES). It was designed to serve as an accessible and
               representative proxy marker of population health status without
               requiring more extensive health data. This paper describes the
               structure and previous applications of the VANDIX for measuring
               relative variations in health outcomes in British Columbia,
               Canada. METHODS: The VANDIX was constructed from a 2005 survey
               of provincial medical health officers asking them to comment on
               the best census markers of health status in British Columbia.
               The VANDIX is based on the weighted summation of seven
               socio-economic variables from the census, including in order of
               weighted importance: proportion without high school completion;
               proportion without university completion; unemployment rate;
               proportion of lone-parent families; average income; proportion
               of home owners; and employment ratio. RESULTS: The VANDIX has
               been applied in numerous research and policy settings across the
               province against several distributions of health status,
               including self-rated health, injury and access to health care
               services. In each assessment, the VANDIX has shown that
               socio-economic inequities parallel health inequities.
               CONCLUSION: SES is one of the most influential factors that
               shape population patterns of health outcomes. Census-based
               indicators of SES such as the VANDIX can serve as easily
               accessible and representative markers of population health
               status, and have application for policy, research and public
               health promotion.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Neighbourhood environments that support active
               living, such as walking or cycling for transportation, may
               decrease the burden of chronic conditions related to sedentary
               behaviour. Many measures exist to summarize features of
               communities that support active living, but few are pan-Canadian
               and none use open data sources that can be widely shared. This
               study reports the development and validation of a novel set of
               indicators of active living environments using open data that
               can be linked to national health surveys and can be used by
               local, regional or national governments for public health
               surveillance. DATA AND METHODS: A Geographic Information System
               (GIS) was used to calculate a variety of measures of the
               connectivity, density and proximity to destinations for 56,589
               dissemination areas (DAs) across Canada (2016 data). Pearson
               correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the
               association between each measure and the rates of walking to
               work and taking active transportation to work (a combination of
               walking, cycling and using public transportation) from census
               data. The active living environment measures selected for the
               final database were used to classify the DAs by the
               favourability of their active living environment into groups by
               k-medians clustering. RESULTS: All measures were correlated with
               walking-to-work and active-transportation-to-work rates at the
               DA level, whether they were derived using proprietary or open
               data sources. Coverage of open data was consistent across
               Canadian regions. Three measures were selected for the Canadian
               Active Living Environments (Can-ALE) dataset based on the
               correlation analysis, but also on the principles of suitability
               for a variety of community sizes and openly available data: (1)
               three-way intersection density of roads and footpaths derived
               from OpenStreetMap (OSM), (2) weighted dwelling density derived
               from Statistics Canada dwelling counts and (3) points of
               interest derived from OSM. A measure of access to public
               transportation was added for the subset of DAs in larger urban
               areas and was strongly related to active-transportation-to-work
               rates. Active-transportation-to-work rates were graded, in
               steps, by the five Can-ALE groups derived from the cluster
               analysis, although walking-to-work rates exceeded the national
               average only in the most favourable active living environments.
               DISCUSSION: Open data may be used to derive measures that
               characterize the active living environments of Canadian

  abstract  = "Play is often defined as activity that is both done for its own
               sake and is characterized by ``means rather than ends''-the
               process of the play is more important than any end point or goal
               that is obvious to the participant or ``naive'' onlooker. These
               criteria contrast play with exploration (which may lead into
               play, as a child gets more familiar with a new toy or
               environment), and with work- or subsistence-related activities
               such as feeding (which have a definite, obvious goal) and
               fighting (different from play fighting, as discussed later).
               Additional common characteristics of human play are flexibility
               (objects being put in new combinations, roles acted out in new
               ways), positive affect (children often smile and laugh in play,
               and say they enjoy it) and pretense (use of objects and actions
               in nonliteral ways). Although play may have no ``obvious'' goal,
               this does not mean that it has no positive benefits. Also, it
               does not mean that play has no evolutionary function(s). In
               fact, the ubiquity of forms of play throughout most mammal
               species, and humans in all cultures studied to date, and the
               time, energy, and sometimes danger costs of engaging in them,
               strongly suggest that selective pressures have acted to favor
               play behaviors, and that they have some functional value for the
               player, even if he or she is not fully aware of it. However, the
               range of functions for play, and strength of evidence for them,
               is still a matter of considerable debate. The following main
               types of play are well recognized: physical activity play
               (rhythmic stereotypies, exercise play; rough-and-tumble play);
               object play; and pretend play (including sociodramatic play as a
               particularly complex form). Of these, physical activity play and
               object play are seen widely in other species of mammals. Pretend
               and sociodramatic play are only seen in humans, apart from some
               possibly very elementary forms of pretense in great apes. A
               related concept in developmental psychology is that of games.
               Games with rules describe more organized forms of play in which
               there is some clear and publicly expressed goal (such as winning
               the game in a manner accepted by other players); games with
               rules are not reviewed furthering this chapter. (PsycINFO

              worldwide. Research indicates that playing outdoors, particularly
              in natural play spaces, boosts children's physical activity,
              potentially decreasing childhood obesity. We present evidence
              that natural play spaces also provide for more diverse forms of
              play for children of varying ages and competencies. This is
              crucial because play spaces designed expressly for physical

              of school hours was assessed by questionnaire, and multi-level

  author   = "Heudtlass, Peter and Guha-Sapir, Debarati and Speybroeck, Niko",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The crude death rate (CDR) is one of the defining
              indicators of humanitarian emergencies. When data from vital
              registration systems are not available, it is common practice to
              estimate the CDR from household surveys with cluster-sampling
              design. However, sample sizes are often too small to compare
              mortality estimates to emergency thresholds, at least in a
              frequentist framework. Several authors have proposed Bayesian
              methods for health surveys in humanitarian crises. Here, we
              develop an approach specifically for mortality data and
              cluster-sampling surveys. METHODS: We describe a Bayesian
              hierarchical Poisson-Gamma mixture model with generic (weakly
              informative) priors that could be used as default in absence of
              any specific prior knowledge, and compare Bayesian and
              frequentist CDR estimates using five different mortality
              datasets. We provide an interpretation of the Bayesian estimates
              in the context of an emergency threshold and demonstrate how to
              interpret parameters at the cluster level and ways in which
              informative priors can be introduced. RESULTS: With the same set
              of weakly informative priors, Bayesian CDR estimates are
              equivalent to frequentist estimates, for all practical purposes.
              The probability that the CDR surpasses the emergency threshold
              can be derived directly from the posterior of the mean of the
              mixing distribution. All observation in the datasets contribute
              to the estimation of cluster-level estimates, through the
              hierarchical structure of the model. CONCLUSIONS: In a context of
              sparse data, Bayesian mortality assessments have advantages over
              frequentist ones already when using only weakly informative
              priors. More informative priors offer a formal and transparent
              way of combining new data with existing data and expert knowledge
              and can help to improve decision-making in humanitarian crises by

              sociodemographic, family, and neighborhood characteristics
              associated with park-based physical activity among adolescents.
              METHODS: Data were from the 2007 California Health Interview
              Survey (CHIS), a population-based survey of California
              households, and were analyzed in 2012-2013 and 2015. This study
              examined individual (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and nativity),
              family (household income, parental education, and nativity), and
              neighborhood characteristics (urbanicity, perceived park
              availability, perceived park safety, neighborhood income, and
              racial composition) associated with engaging in park-based
              physical activity among adolescents. RESULTS: In California, 71\%
              of adolescents reported being physically active the last time
              they visited a park. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression
              analyses, older adolescents and females were less likely to be
              physically active in parks. Adolescents with a park within
              walking distance of home and those with a safe park nearby were
              more likely to be physically active during a park visit.
              CONCLUSIONS: Park availability and perceptions of park safety are
              important predictors of engaging in park-based physical activity
              among adolescents. These findings provide information that can
              help inform interventions intended to increase physical activity

              A previous study has shown that Perceived Naturalness (PN) of

              whether it is possible to detect degree of PN of images using an

              for PN (including a subset that have been assessed for

              image classification service. The resulting labels are assigned
              to broad semantic classes to create a Calculated Semantic

              children play and where they play, such studies rely on
              quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of

              feelings regarding the playability of their environment are
              overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of

              classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the

              traditionally measure neighborhoods at street level and have been
              performed reliably using virtual applications to increase
              feasibility. Research indicates that collection at even higher
              spatial resolution may better elucidate the health impact of
              neighborhood factors, but whether virtual applications can
              reliably capture social determinants of health at the smallest
              geographic resolution (parcel level) remains uncertain. This
              paper presents a novel, parcel-level SSO methodology and assesses
              whether this new method can be collected reliably using Google
              Street View and is feasible. METHODS: Multiple raters (N=5)
              observed 42 neighborhoods. In 2016, inter-rater reliability
              (observed agreement and kappa coefficient) was compared for four
              SSO methods: (1) street-level in person; (2) street-level
              virtual; (3) parcel-level in person; and (4) parcel-level
              virtual. Intra-rater reliability (observed agreement and kappa
              coefficient) was calculated to determine whether parcel-level
              methods produce results comparable to traditional street-level
              observation. RESULTS: Substantial levels of inter-rater agreement
              were documented across all four methods; all methods had >70\% of
              items with at least substantial agreement. Only physical decay
              showed higher levels of agreement (83\% of items with >75\%
              agreement) for direct versus virtual rating source. Intra-rater
              agreement comparing street- versus parcel-level methods resulted
              in observed agreement >75\% for all but one item (90\%).
              CONCLUSIONS: Results support the use of Google Street View as a
              reliable, feasible tool for performing SSO at the smallest
              geographic resolution. Validation of a new parcel-level method

              which is underestimating between-study variability. Although
              Bayesian methods are often recommended for small sample

              features of built environment has been reported in the
              literature. A remaining research challenge is the development of
              methods to efficiently capture pertinent environmental features
              in relevant study settings. Visual streetscape images have been
              used to replace traditional physical audits and directly observe
              the built environment of communities. The aim of this work is to
              examine the inter-method reliability of the two audit methods for
              assessing community environments with a specific focus on
              physical features related to mental health. METHODS: Forty-eight
              postcodes in urban and rural areas of Cambridgeshire, England
              were randomly selected from an alphabetical list of streets
              hosted on a UK property website. The assessment was conducted in
              July and August 2012 by both physical and visual image audits
              based on the items in Residential Environment Assessment Tool
              (REAT), an observational instrument targeting the micro-scale
              environmental features related to mental health in UK postcodes.
              The assessor used the images of Google Street View and virtually
              ``walked through'' the streets to conduct the property and street
              level assessments. Gwet's AC1 coefficients and Bland-Altman plots
              were used to compare the concordance of two audits. RESULTS: The
              results of conducting the REAT by visual image audits generally
              correspond to direct observations. More variations were found in
              property level items regarding physical incivilities, with broad
              limits of agreement which importantly lead to most of the
              variation in the overall REAT score. Postcodes in urban areas had
              lower consistency between the two methods than rural areas.
              CONCLUSIONS: Google Street View has the potential to assess
              environmental features related to mental health with fair
              reliability and provide a less resource intense method of
              assessing community environments than physical audits.",

              buildings) on 1,826 block faces using Google Street View imagery

              Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the
              field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without
              increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation.
              Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to
              robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an
              incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple
              sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing
              objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we
              improve the localization of object boundaries by combining
              methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The
              commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in
              DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization
              accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the
              final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field
              (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to
              improve localization performance. Our proposed ``DeepLab'' system
              sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image
              segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set,
              and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context,
              PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: With the expansion and growth of research on
              neighbourhood characteristics, there is an increased need for
              direct observational field audits. Herein, we introduce a novel
              direct observational audit method and systematic social
              observation instrument (SSOI) for efficiently assessing
              neighbourhood aesthetics over large urban areas. METHODS: Our
              audit method uses spatial random sampling stratified by
              residential zoning and incorporates both mobile geographic
              information systems technology and virtual environments. The
              reliability of our method was tested in two ways: first, in 15
              Ottawa neighbourhoods, we compared results at audited locations
              over two subsequent years, and second; we audited every
              residential block (167 blocks) in one neighbourhood and compared
              the distribution of SSOI aesthetics index scores with results
              from the randomly audited locations. Finally, we present
              interrater reliability and consistency results on all observed
              items. RESULTS: The observed neighbourhood average aesthetics
              index score estimated from four or five stratified random audit
              locations is sufficient to characterize the average neighbourhood
              aesthetics. The SSOI was internally consistent and demonstrated
              good to excellent interrater reliability. At the neighbourhood
              level, aesthetics is positively related to SES and physical
              activity and negatively correlated with BMI. CONCLUSION: The
              proposed approach to direct neighbourhood auditing performs
              sufficiently and has the advantage of financial and temporal

  author   = "Schmidt, A F and Dudbridge, F",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The MR-Egger (MRE) estimator has been proposed to
              correct for directional pleiotropic effects of genetic
              instruments in an instrumental variable (IV) analysis. The power
              of this method is considerably lower than that of conventional
              estimators, limiting its applicability. Here we propose a novel
              Bayesian implementation of the MR-Egger estimator (BMRE) and
              explore the utility of applying weakly informative priors on the
              intercept term (the pleiotropy estimate) to increase power of the
              IV (slope) estimate. METHODS: This was a simulation study to
              compare the performance of different IV estimators. Scenarios
              differed in the presence of a causal effect, the presence of
              pleiotropy, the proportion of pleiotropic instruments and degree
              of 'Instrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect' (InSIDE)
              assumption violation. Based on empirical plasma urate data, we
              present an approach to elucidate a prior distribution for the
              amount of pleiotropy. RESULTS: A weakly informative prior on the
              intercept term increased power of the slope estimate while
              maintaining type 1 error rates close to the nominal value of
              0.05. Under the InSIDE assumption, performance was unaffected by
              the presence or absence of pleiotropy. Violation of the InSIDE
              assumption biased all estimators, affecting the BMRE more than
              the MRE method. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the prior distribution,
              the BMRE estimator has more power at the cost of an increased
              susceptibility to InSIDE assumption violations. As such the BMRE
              method is a compromise between the MRE and conventional IV
              estimators, and may be an especially useful approach to account
              for observed pleiotropy.",

  abstract = "Random effects regression models are routinely used for clustered
              data in etiological and intervention research. However, in
              prediction models, the random effects are either neglected or
              conventionally substituted with zero for new clusters after model
              development. In this study, we applied a Bayesian prediction
              modelling method to the subclinical ketosis data previously
              collected by Van der Drift et al. (2012). Using a dataset of 118
              randomly selected Dutch dairy farms participating in a regular
              milk recording system, the authors proposed a prediction model
              with milk measures as well as available test-day information as
              predictors for the diagnosis of subclinical ketosis in dairy
              cows. While their original model included random effects to
              correct for the clustering, the random effect term was removed
              for their final prediction model. With the Bayesian prediction
              modelling approach, we first used non-informative priors for the
              random effects for model development as well as for prediction.
              This approach was evaluated by comparing it to the original
              frequentist model. In addition, herd level expert opinion was
              elicited from a bovine health specialist using three different
              scales of precision and incorporated in the prediction as
              informative priors for the random effects, resulting in three
              more Bayesian prediction models. Results showed that the Bayesian
              approach could naturally take the clustering structure of
              clusters into account by keeping the random effects in the
              prediction model. Expert opinion could be explicitly combined
              with individual level data for prediction. However in this
              dataset, when elicited expert opinion was incorporated, little
              improvement was seen at the individual level as well as at the
              herd level. When the prediction models were applied to the 118
              herds, at the individual cow level, with the original frequentist
              approach we obtained a sensitivity of 82.4\% and a specificity of
              83.8\% at the optimal cutoff, while with the three Bayesian
              models with elicited expert opinion, we obtained sensitivities
              ranged from 78.7\% to 84.6\% and specificities ranged from 75.0\%
              to 83.6\%. At the herd level, 30 out of 118 within herd
              prevalences were correctly predicted by the original frequentist
              approach, and 31 to 44 herds were correctly predicted by the
              three Bayesian models with elicited expert opinion. Further

              the random effects was carried out and discussed.",

              commonly substituted with the mean zero after model development.
              In this study, we proposed a novel approach of including prior
              knowledge through the random effects distribution and
              investigated to what extent this could improve the predictive
              performance. METHODS: Data were simulated on the basis of a
              random effects logistic regression model. Five prediction models
              were specified: a frequentist model that set the random effects
              to zero for all new clusters, a Bayesian model with weakly
              informative priors for the random effects of new clusters,
              Bayesian models with expert opinion incorporated into low
              informative, medium informative and highly informative priors for
              the random effects. Expert opinion at the cluster level was
              elicited in the form of a truncated area of the random effects
              distribution. The predictive performance of the five models was
              assessed. In addition, impact of suboptimal expert opinion that
              deviated from the true quantity as well as including expert
              opinion by means of a categorical variable in the frequentist
              approach were explored. The five models were further investigated
              in various sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The Bayesian prediction
              model using weakly informative priors for the random effects
              showed similar results to the frequentist model. Bayesian
              prediction models using expert opinion as informative priors
              showed smaller Brier scores, better overall discrimination and
              calibration, as well as better within cluster calibration.
              Results also indicated that incorporation of more precise expert
              opinion led to better predictions. Predictive performance from
              the frequentist models with expert opinion incorporated as
              categorical variable showed similar patterns as the Bayesian
              models with informative priors. When suboptimal expert opinion
              was used as prior information, results indicated that prediction
              still improved in certain settings. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction
              models that incorporated cluster level information showed better
              performance than the models that did not. The Bayesian prediction
              models we proposed, with cluster specific expert opinion
              incorporated as priors for the random effects showed better
              predictive ability in new data, compared to the frequentist

              rainfall, cloud cover, and wind speed. RESULTS: Overall physical
              activity was higher on long days ($\geq$ 14 hours daylight), but
              there was no difference between short (< 9.5 hours) and medium
              days (10.2-12.6 hours). The effect of long day length was largest
              between 5 PM and 8 PM, and persisted after adjusting for
              rainfall, cloud cover, and wind. Up to half this effect was
              explained by a greater duration and intensity of out-of-home play
              on long days; structured sports and active travel were less
              affected by day length. CONCLUSIONS: At least above a certain
              threshold, longer afternoon/evening daylight may have a causal
              role in increasing child physical activity. This strengthens the
              public health arguments for daylight saving measures such as
              those recently under consideration in Britain.",

              the most consistent psychosocial predictors of sexual risk.
              However, substantially less research has examined the
              relationship between these risk variables and adolescent risky
              sexual behavior over time as well as the interaction of these
              individual-level predictors with family-level variables such as
              parenting factors. Additionally, most studies have been
              restricted to one index of risky sexual behavior, have not taken
              into account the complex role of gender, and have not controlled
              for several of the factors that independently confer risk for
              risky sexual behavior. Therefore, the current study investigated
              the association between depressive symptoms and parameters of
              parenting on marijuana use, number of sexual partners and condom
              usage measured 9 months later for both boys and girls.
              Participants were 9th and 10th grade adolescents (N = 1,145;
              57.7\% female). We found that depressive symptoms may be a
              gender-specific risk factor for certain indices of risky sexual
              behavior. For boys only, marijuana use at Time 2 accounted for
              the variance in the relationship between depressive symptoms at
              Time 1 and number of partners at Time 2. Additionally, strictness
              of family rules at Time 1 was associated with the number of
              partners with whom girls engaged in sex at Time 2, but only among
              those with lower levels of depressive symptoms at Time 1. Results
              from the current investigation speak to the utility of examining
              the complex, gender-specific pathways to sexual risk in
              adolescents. Findings suggest that treatment of mental health and
              substance use problems may have important implications in rates
              of risky sexual behavior and, conceivably, controlling the high

                   in-between regular convolution and the depthwise separable
                   convolution operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a
                   pointwise convolution). In this light, a depthwise separable
                   convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a
                   maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us
                   to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network
                   architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules
                   have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We

                   Since the Xception architecture has the same number of
                   parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not
                   due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use

              addressed two research questions: (1) How has active free play
              changed across three generations? (2) What suggestions do
              participants have for reviving active free play? METHODS: Data
              were collected via 49 individual interviews with members of 16
              families (15 grandparents, 16 parents, and 18 children) residing
              in rural areas/small towns in the Province of Alberta (Canada).
              Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and subjected to
              thematic analysis guided by an ecological framework of active
              free play. RESULTS: Factors that depicted the changing nature of
              active free play were coded in the themes of less
              imagination/more technology, safety concerns, surveillance, other
              children to play with, purposeful physical activity, play
              spaces/organized activities, and the good parenting ideal.
              Suggestions for reviving active free play were coded in the
              themes of enhance facilities to keep kids entertained, provide
              more opportunities for supervised play, create more community
              events, and decrease use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: These
              results reinforce the need to consider multiple levels of social
              ecology in the study of active free play, and highlight the
              importance of community-based initiatives to revive active free

              Trial (HBT). Data on children's outdoor playtime and mothers'
              perceived neighbourhood environment were collected through
              face-to-face interviews with mothers when their children were 2
              and 3.5 years old. Walk score was obtained from a publicly
              available website and population density data were obtained from
              Australian Census data. Multiple logistic regression models were
              built to investigate these associations. RESULTS: A total of 497
              and 415 mother-child dyads were retained at 2 years and 3.5
              years. After adjusting for intervention group allocation and
              other confounding factors, at 2 years, mothers' perceptions that
              'the neighbourhood is a good place to bring up children', 'it is
              safe to play outside during the day', and 'there are good parks
              or playgrounds in neighbourhood' were positively associated with
              children's outdoor playtime. At 3.5 years, living in a

              carried out in 2009-2010 and comprised 952 students between 7 and
              9 years of age and 942 parents in Tehran. Two separate
              pre-designed questionnaires were used for children and parent.
              Data was analysed using SPSS 16. RESULTS: The response rate of
              parents' and children's questionnaires regarding to socioeconomic
              deprivation were 830 (88.1\%) from 942 and 932 (97.9\%) from 952
              respectively. Overall, 224 (27.0\%) parents believed that the
              outdoor places children usually play after school are 'not
              dangerous`` while 612 (65.7\%) children believed that the streets

              believed that the volume of traffic in their neighbourhood makes
              crossing roads difficult. There was no significant difference
              between the responses of less and more economically deprived
              parents relating to the presence of dangerous places near their
              home within less than 5-minute walk (66.8\% vs. 62.5\%), on

              in local environment as making crossing the road difficult
              (55.3\% vs. 53.4\%). CONCLUSION: Many parents judged their

              is a more hazardous place than the less deprived areas, it
              suggests that the risk perception among the more deprived parents

              pre-defined search terms related to gambling and child abuse and
              neglect. We identified 601 unique references and excluded studies
              if they did not report original research, or did not specifically
              measure child maltreatment or gambling. Twelve studies that
              included multivariable analysis of childhood maltreatment
              exposure and problem gambling were identified. Six of seven
              studies examining childhood sexual abuse and four of five
              examining physical abuse showed a significant positive
              association between abuse and later gambling problems (odds

              studies examining psychological maltreatment and two of three

              gambling. In most studies, risks were reduced or eliminated when

              associated with sexual risk taking among female juvenile
              offenders; however, the mechanisms by which maltreatment
              influences sexual risk remain poorly understood. We assessed
              whether substance abuse, psychological distress, and dating
              violence mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment
              and unprotected sex. METHODS: Sexually active female juvenile
              offenders (13-17 years of age) completed audio computer-assisted
              self-interviews (n = 232). Logistic regression with a risk
              decrement approach, the Sobel test, and the Goodman I test were
              used to evaluate mediation. RESULTS: Maltreatment before sixth
              grade was common in our sample, including physical abuse
              (48.7\%), sexual abuse (14.7\%), supervision neglect (57.3\%),
              and physical neglect (18.5\%). Cumulative childhood maltreatment
              was also high with 42.2\% reporting two or more types. In the
              fully adjusted model, cumulative childhood maltreatment remained
              associated with unprotected sex (odds ratio, 2.43; 95\%
              confidence interval, 1.27, 4.65). The percent of the total effect
              in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and
              unprotected sex that was mediated by substance abuse was 16.4\%
              (Sobel = 2.54 [p = .01]; Goodman I = 2.49 [p = .01]) and
              psychological distress accounted for 23.7\% (Sobel = 2.55 [p =
              .01]; Goodman I = 2.51 [p = .01]). Dating violence was not a
              significant mediator in our analyses. CONCLUSION: We found a
              strong relationship between childhood maltreatment and
              unprotected sex among female juvenile offenders that was
              partially mediated through substance abuse and psychological
              distress. These findings can be used to develop public health

              evaluate radiographs of children with trampoline related injuries
              and to determine the risk factors. METHODS: Between 2003 and
              2009, 286 children under the age of 16 with backyard trampoline
              injuries were included in the study. The number of injuries
              increased from 13 patients in 2003 to 86 in 2009. The median age
              of the 286 patients was 7 years (range: 1-15 years). Totally 140
              (49\%) patients were males, and 146 (51\%) females. Medical
              records and all available diagnostic imaging were reviewed. A
              questionnaire was sent to the parents to evaluate the
              circumstances of each injury, the type of trampoline, the
              protection equipment and the experience of the children using the
              trampoline. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
              Committee of the University Hospital of Bern. RESULTS: The
              questionnaires and radiographs of the 104 patients were available
              for evaluation. A fracture was sustained in 51 of the 104
              patients. More than 75\% of all patients sustaining injuries and
              in 90\% of patients with fractures were jumping on the trampoline

              fractures were supracondylar humeral fractures (29\%) and forearm
              fractures (25\%). Fractures of the proximal tibia occurred
              especially in younger children between 2-5 years of age.
              CONCLUSIONS: Children younger than 5 years old are at risk for
              specific proximal tibia fractures (``Trampoline Fracture''). A

              mobility and health in the UK is not well established; however,
              research elsewhere suggests that frequent childhood moves may be
              associated with poorer health outcomes and behaviours. The aim of
              this paper was to compare people in the West of Scotland who were
              residentially stable in childhood with those who had moved in
              terms of a range of health measures. METHODS: A total of 850
              respondents, followed-up for a period of 20 years, were included
              in this analysis. Childhood residential mobility was derived from
              the number of addresses lived at between birth and age 18.
              Multilevel regression was used to investigate the relationship
              between childhood residential mobility and health in late
              adolescence (age 18) and adulthood (age 36), accounting for
              socio-demographic characteristics and frequency of school moves.
              The authors examined physical health measures, overall health,
              psychological distress and health behaviours. RESULTS: Twenty per
              cent of respondents remained stable during childhood, 59\% moved
              one to two times and 21\% moved at least three times. For most
              health measures (except physical health), there was an increased
              risk of poor health that remained elevated for frequent movers
              after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and school
              moves (but was only significant for illegal drug use).
              CONCLUSIONS: Risk of poor health was elevated in adolescence and
              adulthood with increased residential mobility in childhood, after
              adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and school moves.
              This was true for overall health, psychological distress and

               contrasting urban environments, London and a lower-density new
               town, the article focuses on how children move around in the

               variations in how contemporary children use their public spaces.
               Children's freedom to move around their neighbourhood was
               greatest in the new town. Girls and minority ethnic children
               were more restricted in their use of urban space. Comparison
               with previous research suggests a decrease in independent use of
               public space for 10/11-year-old English children since the
               1970s. It is argued that future debate about children's place in
               the city should move away from `the unitary public child'. Lack
               of attention to the different ways children use their cities

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As children show a more complex but less structured
              movement behavior than adults, assessment of their many
              spontaneous and impulsive movements is a challenge for physical
              activity (PA) assessment. Since neither questionnaires nor
              accelerometers enable optimal detection of all facets of PA, a
              multimodal, combined approach of self-reported and device-based
              methods is recommended. Based on the number of days on which the
              participants reached the physical activity (PA) values given in
              the WHO guideline, this study examines 1) the difference between
              self-reported and device-based, measured PA and 2) whether PA
              differences between age and gender groups obtained by two methods
              are comparable. METHODS: Participants aged 6-17 years were
              randomly chosen and data were collected representatively at 167
              sample points throughout Germany within the Motorik-Modul Study.
              PA of n = 2694 participants (52.3\% female) was measured using
              the ActiGraph accelerometer (ACC) and a physical activity
              questionnaire (PAQ). The sample was divided into three age groups
              (6-10 yrs. n = 788, 11-13 yrs. n = 823, 14-17 yrs. n = 1083).
              Numbers of days per week with at least 60 min moderate to
              vigorous PA (MVPA) were analyzed for both methods. RESULTS: Only
              every 25th respondent (4\%) reaches the WHO standard of 60 min
              MVPA every day if measured with ACC. Self-reported PA was
              slightly higher (9\%) (meanPAQ = 3.82 days; meanACC = 2.34 days;
              Fmethod = 915.85; p = <.001; fCohen = .64). The differences
              between the methods are significantly smaller in younger children
              than in the older age groups (Fage = 264.2, p < .001; fCohen =
              .48). The older the subjects are, the lower is the proportion of
              those who meet the WHO guideline on each day, with girls meeting
              the guideline less frequently than boys in all age groups.
              CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents living in Germany show a
              very low adherence to the WHO guideline on PA. While younger
              children are much more active with their free play, especially
              children over 10 years of age and especially girls should be the
              target of programs to increase PA.",

              children and adolescents (0-18 years) spend in self-directed

  abstract = "A continued decrease in outdoor play time among children has
              contributed to the decline in their overall physical activity

              for outdoor play can help promote physical activity especially
              among children lacking private play areas. Further, children from
              different cultural backgrounds may be influenced by different
              factors when deciding if or where to play. This paper examines
              differences in outdoor play patterns and locations, and their
              correlates between Hispanic and non-Hispanic White children. A
              total of 3449 elementary school students (69.3\% Hispanic) were
              recruited in 2010 from 20 schools in the Austin Independent
              School District, Texas. Using the data collected from their
              parental survey, two multivariable linear regression models were
              estimated to identify correlates of outdoor play time for each
              ethnic group. Hispanic children used fewer types of places to
              play outdoors but for more minutes/weekday. A high residential
              density appeared as a facilitator among White children, while a
              connected street pattern (more intersections/crossings)
              functioned as a barrier among Hispanic children. Neighborhood
              safety, destinations, and land uses were important in both ethnic
              groups, but differences were found in the specific associations.
              Findings suggest that intervention strategies to promote outdoor
              play should respond to the specific needs, preferences, and
              external constraints of children from different cultural
              backgrounds. The strategies should also be tailored to provide
              safer places for Hispanic children. This proposes public
              participation from diverse ethnic groups in processes of planning
              and infrastructure decision-making to reflect different

              function of gender. We assessed family functioning of 302
              Hispanic adolescents (47 \% female) and their parent (70 \%

              relationship between sedentary behavior and health risk
              indicators, an overview of public health recommendations, the

              is a narrative style review and not systematic, where possible,
              findings from relevant review papers were summarized and a search
              of more recent literature was performed using computer-based

              Science Index, SportDiscus, and Health Reference Center -
              Academic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Young people spend 2-4 hours per
              day in screen-based behaviors and 5-10 hours per day sedentary.
              Ethnicity, sociodemographic status, having a TV set in the
              bedroom, and parental behavior appear to be the most consistent
              correlates of TV viewing time; however, few recent studies aiming
              to reduce TV viewing or sedentary time among young people have
              been successful. CONCLUSIONS: A growing body of evidence supports
              the development of public health recommendations to limit the
              time spent in screen-based behaviors. More research is needed to
              examine the prospective and experimental evidence of associations
              between overall sedentary time and health, determinants of
              sedentary behaviors other than screen-based behaviors, and
              interventions to reduce overall sedentary time or even

              among internalizing and externalizing symptoms and harsh
              parenting because they may cascade over time in this early
              period. Harsh parenting uniquely contributed to externalizing
              symptoms, controlling for internalizing symptoms, but not vice
              versa. In addition, internalizing symptoms appeared to be a
              mechanism by which externalizing symptoms increase. Results
              highlight the importance of accounting for both internalizing and
              externalizing symptoms from an early age to understand risk for
              developing psychopathology and the role harsh parenting plays in
              influencing these trajectories.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Participation in physical play/leisure (PPP) is an
              important therapy goal of children with motor impairments.
              Evidence for interventions promoting PPP in these children is
              scarce. The first step is to identify modifiable, clinically
              meaningful predictors of PPP for targeting by interventions.
              OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to identify, in children with
              motor impairments, body function and structure, activity,
              environmental, and personal factors related to PPP and modifiable
              by therapists. DESIGN: This was a mixed-methods, intervention
              development study. The World Health Organization framework
              International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
              Health was used. METHODS: Participants were children (6-8 years
              old) with motor impairments, mobilizing independently with or
              without equipment and seen by physical therapists or occupational
              therapists in 6 regions in the United Kingdom, and their parents.
              Self-reported PPP was assessed with the Children's Assessment of
              Participation and Enjoyment. Modifiable-factor data were
              collected with therapists' observations, parent questionnaires,
              and child-friendly interviews. The Children's Assessment of
              Participation and Enjoyment, therapist, and parent data were
              analyzed using descriptive statistics and linear regression.
              Interview data were analyzed for emerging themes. RESULTS:
              Children's (n=195) PPP (X=18 times per week, interquartile
              range=11-25) was mainly 'recreational' (eg, pretend play, playing
              with pets) rather than 'active physical' (eg, riding a
              bike/scooter). Parents (n=152) reported positive beliefs about
              children's PPP but various levels of family PPP. Therapists
              reported 23 unique impairments (eg, muscle tone), 16 activity
              limitations (eg, walking), and 3 personal factors (eg, child's
              PPP confidence). Children interviewed (n=17) reported a strong
              preference for active play but indicated that adults regulated
              their PPP. Family PPP and impairment in the child's
              movement-related body structures explained 18\% of the variation
              in PPP. Family PPP explained most of the variation. LIMITATIONS:
              It is likely that the study had a degree of self-selection bias,
              and caution must be taken in generalizing the results to children
              whose parents have less positive views about PPP. CONCLUSIONS:
              The results converge with wider literature about the child's
              social context as a PPP intervention target. In addition, the
              results question therapists' observations in explaining PPP.",

              Peers, School, Community and the Built Environment, and

              standardized grading framework (from A = excellent, to F =
              failing). The 38 Report Cards were presented at the International
              Congress on Physical Activity and Public Health in Bangkok,
              Thailand on November 16, 2016. The consolidated findings are
              summarized in the form of a Global Matrix demonstrating
              substantial variation in grades both within and across countries.
              Countries that lead in certain indicators often lag in others.
              Average grades for both Overall Physical Activity and Sedentary
              Behavior around the world are D (low/poor). In contrast, the
              average grade for indicators related to supports for physical
              activity was C. Lower-income countries generally had better
              grades on Overall Physical Activity, Active Transportation, and
              Sedentary Behaviors compared with higher-income countries, yet
              worse grades for supports from Family and Peers, Community and
              the Built Environment, and Government Strategies and Investments.
              Average grades for all indicators combined were highest (best) in
              Denmark, Slovenia, and the Netherlands. Many surveillance and
              research gaps were apparent, especially for the Active Play and
              Family and Peers indicators. International cooperation and
              cross-fertilization is encouraged to address existing challenges,
              understand underlying determinants, conceive innovative
              solutions, and mitigate the global childhood inactivity crisis.
              The paradox of higher physical activity and lower sedentary
              behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower
              physical activity and higher sedentary behavior in countries

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A substantial increase in the number of nonpowered and
              powered scooter injuries since 2000 has occurred in the United
              States. Because of differences in weight and operational speed
              between scooter types, it is possible that the type and severity
              of injuries may differ. The purpose of the current study is to
              compare demographics and injury characteristics between scooter
              types, focusing on differences in injury severity. METHODS: The
              2002-2006 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System provided
              information about individuals aged 2 to 12 years who sought
              treatment at an emergency department due to powered or nonpowered
              scooter-related injury in the United States. We defined severe
              injury as an injury resulting in the hospitalization, staying in
              the hospital for observation, or transfer of the injured patient.
              Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age, and
              geographic location in which the injury occurred, estimated odds
              ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the
              association between scooter type and severe injury. RESULTS:
              There were an estimated 15 752 and 185 007 injuries related to
              powered and nonpowered scooters, respectively. Powered
              scooter-related injuries were over 3 times as likely to be severe
              (OR 3.57, 95\% CI, 1.91-6.65). This association was more
              prominent among females (OR 5.80, 95\% CI, 2.02-16.63) than males
              (OR 2.90, 95\% CI, 1.44-5.82). CONCLUSION: Data suggest that,
              compared with nonpowered scooter-related injuries, powered
              scooter-related injuries are more often severe. This association
              is stronger among females than males. The higher risk of severe
              injury due to powered scooter use could result from increases in
              concussions and hip and lower extremity injuries.",

              that natural play spaces also provide for more diverse forms of
              play for children of varying ages and competencies. This is
              crucial because play spaces designed expressly for physical

              summer camp taking place in the Vologda Region of Russia were
              exposed to 1 session context/day (i.e., free play, organized with
              no choice, organized with choice) on Wednesday, Thursday, and
              Friday for 3 weeks, with the context order counterbalanced across
              the 3 weeks. The organized session sport/game changed weekly. The
              primary outcome was accelerometer-assessed PA. Repeated-measures

              poorly understood. The Population Health Framework suggests that
              the etiology of adolescent injury involves interactions between
              individual risk factors and the natures of adolescent
              environments. The purpose of this study was to apply this
              framework to examination of relationships between adolescent risk
              taking and injury, and the potential modifying effects of
              supportive home and school environments. METHODS: The analysis
              was conducted in a representative sample of 7235 males and
              females (10-16 years old) from Canada. Results were based on
              records from the 2001/02 World Health Organization Health
              Behaviour in School-Aged Children Survey. Individual items and
              factor analytically derived scales were used to describe and then
              model injury outcomes, risk behaviors, perceived home, and school
              climates, and the relationships between these variables in a
              theory driven etiological analysis. RESULTS: Adolescents with
              supportive home and school environments experienced lower
              relative odds of engagement in risk taking behavior and lower
              relative odds of injury. Gradients were observed between the
              extent of adolescent risk taking and the occurrence of injury.
              Interactions were not observed between risk taking behavior,
              perceived support in home and school climates, and injury.
              CONCLUSIONS: Risk taking is common among adolescents and plays a
              role in the etiology of injury. Supportive social climates
              clearly protect adolescents from engaging in these behaviors, and
              also the occurrence of some forms of injury. However, once an
              adolescent chooses to engage in risk taking behaviour, a
              supportive environment may not protect them from injury.",

              substance use, and poor mental health were collected from 1831
              year 9 students (age range, 14-16 years). Participants were

              Results Almost half (46\%) of the participants experienced
              problematic pain. Adolescents with problematic pain, compared to
              those without pain, reported higher substance use and poorer

              sleep and health-risk behaviors in adolescents living in rural

              ($\beta$ = -0.32 kJ g(-1)), added sugar ($\beta$ = -1.50 E\%) and
              SSBs ($\beta$ = -1.07 E\%) (all P $\leq$ 0.003). Furthermore,
              variability in sleep duration (10-min per night) was positively
              associated with SSBs ($\beta$ = 0.20 E\%, P = 0.03), independent
              of sleep duration, and CSHQ score was positively associated with
              ED ($\beta$ = 0.16 kJ g(-1), P = 0.04). All of these associations
              were independent of potential confounders (age, sex, pubertal
              status, height, weight, screen time, moderate-to-vigorous
              physical activity and parental education and ethnicity).
              CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that short sleep duration, high
              sleep duration variability and experiencing sleep problems are
              all associated with a poor, obesity-promoting diet in children.",

              regard to their social skills and play behaviors. METHOD: The
              social skills and free-play behaviors of 30 3- to 5-year-old
              maltreated and nonmaltreated children were compared. Fifteen
              children with a range of maltreatment experiences drawn from a
              hospital-based therapeutic nursery treatment program and 15
              demographically similar children drawn from a home-based Head
              Start program participated in the study. All children were of low
              socioeconomic status. Children's free-play peer interactions were
              videotaped during the first 3 months of attendance in either
              program and analyzed along social and cognitive dimensions.
              Teachers and therapists rated children's social skills in peer
              interactions. RESULTS: Maltreated children were found to have
              significantly poorer skill in initiating interactions with peers
              and maintaining self-control, as well as a greater number of
              problem behaviors. Significant differences were not found between
              groups with regard to social participation or cognitive level of

              has been observed and it is well documented that low levels of
              activity are associated with poor health. In an attempt to
              understand factors that influence physical activity (PA) in young
              people research was undertaken with high school students in New
              Zealand to identify preferred places for PA and establish factors
              that they felt influenced levels of PA. METHODS: One hundred
              males and 73 females in year nine (aged 12-13) in health and
              physical education classes completed mapping exercises in which
              they delineated favourite and least favourite places for PA,
              where they went on a particular Sunday, how they got there and
              what they did, and chosen after-school activities and how they
              got there. RESULTS: Open public spaces were the most favoured
              places for PA with a nearby beach and park most frequently cited.
              Specific physical activities, having fun, and having friends to
              do an activity with were the most frequently cited reasons for
              liking these places. An industrial harbour area, other schools,
              and cemeteries were the least favoured places. Less than 2\%
              biked somewhere on the Sunday surveyed and only 23\% walked
              somewhere. The majority were driven to activities by car and a
              similar reliance on cars was observed for after-school
              activities. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of environmental and
              social factors is important in both encouraging and discouraging
              PA and should be taken into account when seeking to enhance PA of
              young people.",

              restricting outdoor play in response to a perceived lack of
              safety and fear of violence and crime in urban environments. The
              study objective was to determine whether parents who perceived
              their neighborhood as unsafe would be most likely to restrict
              their child's outdoor play and report the greatest worries
              related to neighborhood characteristics. METHODS: A convenience
              sample of primary caregivers of children aged 5 years to 7 years
              were recruited from a pediatric primary care center based at an
              urban academic children's hospital. Study participants completed
              a 23-question survey available in English and Spanish. RESULTS:
              Two hundred fifty-four parents completed the survey. Most were
              English speakers (69\%), female (89\%), and aged between 21 years
              and 35 years (76\%). Sixty-two percent let their child play
              outside often or sometimes; whereas 19\% reported never allowing
              their child to play outside. Parents were less likely to allow
              outside play as their degree of worry increased about traffic (p
              < 0.0001), rundown parks (p < 0.003), crime (p < 0.0001),
              witnessing violence (p < 0.0001), being a victim of violence (p <
              0.0009), drugs (p < 0.0001), gangs (p < 0.004), and weapons (p <
              0.003). Frequency of outdoor play was not correlated with the sex
              or age of the child or number of children in the family. Spanish
              speakers were less likely to allow outside play (p < 0.008) but
              more likely to allow unsupervised play (p < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:
              Decreased frequency of outdoor play correlated with increased
              parental concerns about safety, however, many parents still
              report allowing outdoor play at least sometimes.",

              Eighty-one children (47 girls) wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph

              relationship between residential neighborhood amenities and
              physical activity among U.S. children with SHCN. Methods A
              nationally representative sample of 113,767 children aged 6-17
              years was taken from National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)
              2007-2008 and 2011-2012. Residential neighborhood amenities were
              defined by parent-reported presence or absence of sidewalks,
              parks/playgrounds, and recreation center. Physical activity was
              measured by parent-reported number of physically active days
              (0-7), defined as 20 min or longer during the past week. Negative
              binomial regressions were performed to estimate the associations
              between residential neighborhood amenities and physical activity
              among U.S. children with and without SHCN, adjusting for various
              neighborhood (detracting condition and safety) and individual
              characteristics and NSCH sampling design. Results Approximately
              23\% of young children aged 6-11 years and adolescents aged 12-17
              years had SHCN. Number of weekly physically active days was both
              4.8 among young children with and without SHCN, and 3.7 and 4.1
              among adolescents with and without SHCN, respectively. Among
              young children with SHCN, neighborhood availability of a
              recreation center was associated with increased weekly physically
              active days by 0.23; whereas among young children without SHCN,
              number of weekly physically active days was not associated with
              the availability of any amenity. Among adolescents with SHCN,
              neighborhood availability of parks/playgrounds was associated
              with increased weekly physically active days by 0.33, whereas
              neighborhood availability of sidewalks was associated with

              Head Start was associated with greater changes in body mass index
              (BMI) over the course of a preschool year. METHOD: The authors
              used data from 2810 children from the Family and Child
              Experiences Survey 2006 cohort. With children's spring BMI as the
              outcome (both continuously measured and dichotomized to measure
              the risk of obesity), the authors conducted weighted regression
              analyses, controlling for child-level, family-level, and
              school-level covariates, including preschool entry BMI. RESULTS:
              Children played outdoors at school for roughly 37 minutes per
              day, with little variation across half-day and full-day programs.
              The more children played outdoors, the more their BMI decreased
              over the preschool year ($\beta$ = -.05, 95\% confidence interval
              (CI) [-0.08 to -0.01]) and the less likely they were to be obese
              (odds ratio = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.98-0.99]). The difference between
              high levels and low levels of outdoor play corresponded to 0.18
              BMI points and a 42\% reduction in children's risk of obesity.
              Sixty minutes was the ``tipping point'' for the association
              between outdoor play time and improvements in children's BMI.
              These associations were also stronger among children who were
              obese at the start of the year, less active at home, and living
              in unsafe neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: Outdoor play time at Head
              Start is associated with decreases in children's BMI scores and,
              thus, may serve as an important means of preventing obesity. Head
              Start programs should consider establishing clear guidelines

              including sampling, data collection procedures, response rates,
              data processing, weighting, and analyses. The 2021 YRBS
              participation map, survey response rates, and a detailed
              examination of student demographic characteristics are included
              in this report. During 2021, in addition to the national YRBS, a
              total of 78 surveys were administered to high school students
              across the United States, representing the national population,
              45 states, two tribal governments, three territories, and 28
              local school districts. YRBSS data from 2021 provided the first
              opportunity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to compare
              youth health behaviors using long-term public health
              surveillance. Approximately half of all student respondents
              represented racial and ethnic minority groups, and approximately
              one in four identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or
              other (a sexual identity other than heterosexual) (LGBQ+). These
              findings reflect shifts in youth demographics, with increased
              percentages of racial and ethnic minority and LGBQ+ youths
              compared with previous YRBSS cycles. Educators, parents, local
              decision makers, and other partners use YRBSS data to monitor
              health behavior trends, guide school health programs, and develop
              local and state policy. These and future data can be used in
              developing health equity strategies to address long-term
              disparities so that all youths can thrive in safe and supportive
              environments. This overview and methods report is one of 11
              featured in this MMWR supplement. Each report is based on data
              collected using methods presented in this overview. A full

              physical activity is stimulating unstructured outside play.
              PURPOSE: This study examined whether characteristics of the
              family and perceived physical environment were associated with
              the duration of children's outside play. METHODS: Parents
              participating in the ``Be Active, Eat Right'' cluster RCT control
              group (N = 2007) provided information on potential predictors of
              outside play (i.e. family and perceived physical environment) of
              their 5-year-old child by questionnaire. Child outside play was
              assessed by parental reports both at five and seven years. Linear
              regression analyses, adjusted for seasonality, were performed to
              evaluate associations between potential predictors and child
              outside play. Linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the
              relationship between potential predictors and the development of
              outside play over two years, with season entered as a random
              factor. RESULTS: Family environment was the strongest construct
              predicting child outside play, while parent perceived physical
              environment had no significant association with child outside
              play. Parental habit strength and the presence of rules were the
              strongest predictors of increased outside play. Parent perceived
              difficulty in improving child outside play was the strongest
              predictor of decreased outside play. CONCLUSION: Family
              environment predicted child outside play and not perceived
              physical environment. Parental rules and habit strength regarding
              improving outside play were associated with an improvement of
              child's engagement in outside play.",

               sources of health-related change. Age (or, life course) effects
               are individual, often biological, sources of change, whilst
               periods and cohorts can be thought of as social contexts
               affecting individuals that reside within them. Due to the
               mathematical confounding of age, period and cohort, careful
               consideration of each is important -- otherwise what appears to
               be, for example, a period (year) effect could in fact be a
               mixture of age and cohort processes. Naive life course
               approaches could thus produce misleading results when APC
               effects are not all considered. However, the mathematical
               confounding also often makes modelling all three effects
               together impossible, and the dangers of attempting to do so, or
               of ignoring one effect without critical forethought, is
               illustrated through the example of the obesity epidemic. This
               example uses Yang and Land's Hierarchical APC model which it is
               claimed (incorrectly) solves the identification problem.
               Finally, we suggest a flexible multilevel framework that extends
               Yang and Land's model, and by making relatively strong
               assumptions (in this case that there are no long-run period
               trends) can model age, period and cohort effects robustly and
               explicitly, so long as those assumptions are correct. This is
               illustrated using health data from the British Household Panel
               Survey. We argue that this theory driven approach is often the
               most appropriate for conceptualising APC effects, and producing
               valid empirical inference about both individual life courses and
               the spatial and temporal contexts in which they exist.",

  author   = "Watson, Libby A and Baker, Martyn C and Chadwick, Paul M",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To explore children's accounts of their experiences
              of the UK's largest childhood obesity programme, MEND (Mind,
              Exercise, Nutrition...Do it!) (See www.mendprogramme.org).
              DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with children
              who had completed the MEND obesity programme. Interviews were
              transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretative
              Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). METHOD: Fourteen children
              spanning diverse areas of London comprised this study (eight
              male, six female), aged between 11 and 14 years and in secondary
              school. Participants were interviewed a year after completing one
              of the London-based MEND obesity programmes. RESULTS: This
              article focuses on the most common and striking theme to emerge
              from the original dataset (The complete analysis may be found in
              L. Watson, Unpublished doctoral thesis): Fun. Subthemes were:
              'going with the flow'; active participation in activities that
              led to new experiences ('actually doing it' - seeing the fun
              side); the importance of others in the experience of fun ('you do
              games in unity' - 'it's not as fun on your own'). CONCLUSION:
              Children have fun when engaged in interactive and varied
              activities with opportunity for individual feedback and
              improvement. When designing childhood obesity programmes,
              conditions that optimise children's experience of fun should be
              emphasised over didactic and risk-heavy information pertaining to
              childhood obesity. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already
              known on this subject? Continued growth in childhood obesity and
              its associated health problems, psychological effects, and
              economic burden make tackling childhood obesity a public health
              priority. Multicomponent lifestyle interventions to treat
              childhood obesity within the community have been shown to reduce
              overweight and obesity from pre- to post-treatment, increase
              self-esteem, and are found to be acceptable by parents. MEND is
              the most widely disseminated evidence-based programme of this
              kind in the United Kingdom. What does this study add? This study
              is the first qualitative study to explore the child's experience
              of attending MEND. The post-treatment maintenance period, where
              most behaviour change is consolidated (or not), is also captured
              in this study, with children interviewed at least 1 year
              post-treatment. Findings unearthed an unexpected and strong theme
              - that of 'fun' - integral to their experience during their time
              at MEND. Optimizing conditions for fun is imperative to
              children's (and adults'?) engagement with, and maintenance of,
              healthy lifestyle activities.",

              population in Eastern Ontario. METHODS: Epidemiologic analysis of
              emergency-based surveillance data (1994-2000) for infants (<12
              months old) from the Kingston sites of the Canadian Hospitals
              Injury Reporting and Prevention Program. RESULTS: A total of 990
              cases of injury to infants were identified, of which 217 (21.9\%)
              required significant medical intervention. Leading causes of
              injury were falls (605/990; 61.1\%), ingestion injuries (65/990;
              6.6\%), and burns (56/990; 5.7\%). Common types of falls
              experienced were: from furniture (229/605; 37.9\%), being dropped
              (92/605; 15.2\%), in car seats (73/605; 12.1\%), down stairs
              (63/605; 10.4\%), or in a child walker (42/605; 6.9\%). The
              observed patterns of injury changed according to the ages of the

              patterns (falls, physical vulnerability, burns and ingestions,

              relative importance of several external causes of injury and how
              these vary by age group. This population-based information is
              also useful in establishing rational priorities for prevention,

              to account for the impact that underlying differences between
              mobile and non-mobile youth have on this relationship. In this
              study we utilise multilevel models with longitudinal data to
              simultaneously estimate between-child and within-child effects in
              the relationship between residential mobility and cannabis use,
              allowing us to determine the extent to which cannabis use in
              adolescence is driven by residential mobility and unobserved
              confounding. Data come from a UK cohort, The Avon Longitudinal
              Study of Parents and Children. Consistent with previous research
              we find a positive association between cumulative residential
              mobility and cannabis use when using multilevel extensions of
              conventional logistic regression models (log odds: 0.94, standard
              error: 0.42), indicating that children who move houses are more
              likely to use cannabis than those who remain residentially
              stable. However, decomposing this relationship into within- and
              between-child components reveals that the conventional model is
              underspecified and misleading; we find that differences in
              cannabis use between mobile and non-mobile children are due to
              underlying differences between these groups (between-child log
              odds: 3.56, standard error: 1.22), not by a change in status of
              residential mobility (within-child log odds: 1.33, standard
              error: 1.02). Our findings suggest that residential mobility in
              the teenage years does not place children at an increased risk of
              cannabis use throughout these years.",

              effective preventive programs. The present review focuses on
              sleep duration as a potential risk factor for childhood obesity.
              The aim is to summarize the evidence on the association of sleep
              duration and obesity and to discuss the underlying potential
              physiological and/or pathophysiological mechanisms. DATA
              SYNTHESIS: The Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register
              of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched for papers
              using text words with appropriate truncation and relevant
              indexing terms. All studies objectively measuring sleep duration
              and investigating the association between sleep duration and
              obesity or factors (lifestyle and hormonal) possibly associated
              with obesity were included, without making restrictions based on
              study design or language. Data from eligible studies were
              extracted in tabular form and summarized narratively. After
              removing duplicates, 3540 articles were obtained. Finally, 33
              studies (including 3 randomized controlled trials and 30
              observational studies) were included in the review. CONCLUSION:
              Sleep duration seems to influence weight gain in children,
              however, the underlying explanatory mechanisms are still
              uncertain. In our review only the link between short sleep
              duration and the development of insulin resistance, sedentarism
              and unhealthy dietary patterns could be verified, while the role
              of other mediators, such as physical activity, screen time,
              change in ghrelin and leptin levels, remained uncertain. There
              are numerous evidence gaps. To answer the remaining questions,
              there is a need for studies meeting high methodological standards
              and including a large number of children.Copyright \copyright{}

              together and lead to risk behaviour syndromes. Multiple risk
              behaviors in turn become important determinants of health
              outcomes, including injuries. METHODS: A national sample (n =
              11,415) of Canadian youth aged 11-15 years was examined from the
              1997-1998 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Survey.
              Principal components analyses were used to characterize how
              adolescent risk behaviors cluster together into factors.
              Associations between these behavioral factors and injury outcomes
              were explored via multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS:
              Two factors of risk behaviors emerged: lifestyle risks and
              psychological risks. Strong associations between the lifestyle
              risk scale and the occurrence of head and neck injuries were
              identified (P < 0.001 for trend). The relative odds for the
              highest quintile versus the lowest quintile were 6.96 (95\% CI:
              3.95-12.26). Similar injury risks were not identified in

              injury to young people and provide a reliable method by which
              researchers can quantify two determinants of health. These are

              determinants of independent active free play were child
              characteristics (age, competence, and gender), parental
              restrictions (safety concerns and surveillance), neighborhood and
              physical environment (fewer children to play with, differences in
              preferences for play spaces between parents and children,
              accessibility and proximity, and maintenance), societal changes
              (reduced sense of community, good parenting ideal, changing roles
              of parents, privatization of playtime and play spaces), and
              policy issues (need to give children voice). An ecological model
              depicting these factors, and the relationships therein, was
              created. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive meta-study helps
              establish a knowledge base for children's independent active free
              play research by synthesizing a previously fragmented set of
              studies. Parents' perceived safety concerns are the primary
              barrier to children's active free play. These safety concerns are
              moderated by child-level factors (age, competence, gender) and
              broader social issues. Interventions should focus on
              community-level solutions that include children's perspectives.
              From a methods perspective, the reviewed studies used a range of
              data collection techniques, but methodological details were often
              inadequately reported. The theoretical sophistication of research
              in this area could be improved. To this end, the synthesis
              reported in this study provides a framework for guiding future
              research.",

              risks of hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular
              diseases associated with four air pollutants: sulphur dioxide,
              nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter with an
              aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m (PM10). We then
              calculated the sum of excess risks of the hospital admissions
              associated with these air pollutants. The cut-off points of the
              summed excess risk, for the issuance of different health
              warnings, were based on the concentrations of these pollutants
              recommended as short-term Air Quality Guidelines by the World
              Health Organization. The excess risks were adjusted downwards for
              young children and the elderly. Health risk was grouped into five
              categories and sub-divided into eleven bands, with equal
              increments in excess risk from band 1 up to band 10 (the 11th
              band is `band 10+'). We developed health warning messages for the

              elderly, and people with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory

              sudden rise in air pollutant concentrations and the issue of a
              health warning, and the reliance on one dominant pollutant to
              calculate the index. Hence, the AQHI represents an improvement
              over Hong Kong's existing air pollution index.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The effect of nature-based interventions on
              self-reported mental well-being in patients with physical disease
              is gaining increasing attention. However, there is a lack of
              randomized controlled trials investigating this area. Due to the
              massive costs in health care systems, there is a need for new
              strategies to address these issues and an urgent need for
              attention to this field. Nature-based interventions are low cost,
              easy to implement, and should get attention within the health
              care field. Therefore, the objective was to find the impact of
              nature interventions on mental well-being in humans with a
              physical disease. METHODS: In four major databases (PubMed,
              Cinahl, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library), a systematic review of
              quantitative studies of nature's impact on self-reported mental
              health in patients with physical disease was performed. A total
              of 1909 articles were retrieved but only five met the inclusion
              criteria and were summarized. RESULTS: All five studies were
              quantitative, with a control group and a nature-based
              intervention. A source of heterogeneity was identified: the
              patients in one of the five studies were psychosomatic. In the
              four studies with somatic patients, significant benefit of nature
              on self-reported mental health outcomes was found; the only study
              that failed to show a significant benefit was the one with
              psychosomatic patients. CONCLUSION: A significant effect of
              nature on mental well-being of patients with somatic disease was
              found. The result in patients with psychosomatic disease is
              inconclusive, and more studies in this category are needed.

              merited, with special attention to standardizing intervention

              emergent need to develop a robust prediction model for estimating
              an individual absolute risk for all-cause mortality, so that
              relevant assessments and interventions can be targeted
              appropriately. The objective of the study was to derive, evaluate
              and validate (internally and externally) a risk prediction model
              allowing rapid estimations of an absolute risk of all-cause
              mortality in the following 10 years. METHODS: For the model
              development, data came from English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
              study, which comprised 9154 population-representative individuals
              aged 50-75 years, 1240 (13.5\%) of whom died during the 10-year
              follow-up. Internal validation was carried out using Harrell's
              optimism-correction procedure; external validation was carried
              out using Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which is a
              nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults aged
              $\geq$50 years residing in the United States. Cox proportional
              hazards model with regularisation by the least absolute shrinkage
              and selection operator, where optimisation parameters were chosen
              based on repeated cross-validation, was employed for variable
              selection and model fitting. Measures of calibration,
              discrimination, sensitivity and specificity were determined in
              the development and validation cohorts. RESULTS: The model
              selected 13 prognostic factors of all-cause mortality
              encompassing information on demographic characteristics, health
              comorbidity, lifestyle and cognitive functioning. The internally
              validated model had good discriminatory ability (c-index=0.74),
              specificity (72.5\%) and sensitivity (73.0\%). Following external
              validation, the model's prediction accuracy remained within a
              clinically acceptable range (c-index=0.69, calibration slope
              $\beta$=0.80, specificity=71.5\% and sensitivity=70.6\%). The
              main limitation of our model is twofold: 1) it may not be
              applicable to nursing home and other institutional populations,
              and 2) it was developed and validated in the cohorts with
              predominately white ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: A new prediction
              model that quantifies absolute risk of all-cause mortality in the
              following 10-years in the general population has been developed
              and externally validated. It has good prediction accuracy and is
              based on variables that are available in a variety of care and
              research settings. This model can facilitate identification of
              high risk for all-cause mortality older adults for further

              collected from 177 persons participating in the Danish part of
              the European Youth Hearth Study (EYHS) was used to examine the
              effect of the built environment on PA. A MI was developed using
              objectively measured built environment characteristics, and
              included residential density, recreational facilities, daily
              destinations and street connectivity. RESULTS: Results showed a
              positive cross-sectional association between MI and PA. PA
              decreased from baseline to follow-up. MI increased, primarily due
              to participants relocating to larger cities. An increase in MI
              from baseline to follow-up was associated with a reduced decrease

              built environment is a determinant for PA, especially for
              females. The found gender differences might suggest the need to
              develop gender specific environmental indices in future studies.
              The validity of the measures can be further improved by creating
              domain specific PA measures as well as domain specific

              media attention of these tools, a word of caution is warranted.
              One common misconception relates to the effect of the weights
              assigned to indicators during the aggregation process. This work
              presents a novel series of tools that allow developers and users
              of composite indicators to explore effects of these weights.
              First, the importance of each indicator to the composite is
              measured by the nonlinear Pearson correlation ratio, estimated by
              Bayesian Gaussian processes. Second, the effect of each indicator
              is isolated from that of other indicators using regression
              analysis, and examined in detail. Finally, an optimisation
              procedure is proposed which allows weights to be fitted to agree
              with pre-specified values of importance. These three tools
              together give developers considerable insight into the effects of
              weights and suggest possibilities for refining and simplifying
              the aggregation. The added value of these tools are shown on

A limited amount of literature uses walkability as a proxy for runnability, thereby misjudging the differing goals of walking and running: leisure, sport or commute. We create a rough runnability index using an affordance-based framework as a conceptual and methodological attempt to quantify features of the built environment that facilitate or hinder running as a form of leisure or sport activity. Three indices are created in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada using pixelated edges. We find that areas in the downtown core and near high traffic routes show low safety and general runnability, whereas areas near parks and in low traffic, residential areas show higher safety for runners. Representing runnability using pixelated edges allows for sub-block level analysis of runnability as experienced by runners. }

              the aforementioned behavioural risk factors, whereas 9.9\% had
              three or more lifestyle risk factors. Males [adjusted odds ratio
              (aOR) = 2.50; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 2.17-2.88] and
              respondents of middle (aOR = 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.36-1.89) or lower
              income (aOR = 2.63; 95\% CI: 2.12-3.26) were more likely to
              report co-occurrence of behavioural risk factors, as well as
              respondents in Northern (aOR = 1.43; 95\% CI: 1.14-1.78), Western
              (aOR = 1.28; 95\% CI: 1.06-1.56) and Eastern Europe (aOR = 1.28;
              95\% CI: 1.06-1.55), when compared with Southern European
              respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The above analyses indicate significant
              geographical and social variation in the distribution of the
              co-occurrence of behavioural risk factors for disease
              development.",

              This was most obvious when infectious disease was the primary

              However, findings from Anglo-American countries may not apply to
              the European context. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the
              existing evidence on the role of the built environment for
              leading risk factors and health behavior in Germany. Methods:
              Through an extensive search via PubMed and Web of Science, using
              predefined selection criteria, two independent reviewers
              identified 25 empirical studies. We described the main study
              variables (year of publication, study design, data source, sample
              characteristics), classified the studies according to their
              respective operationalization of environmental features and
              health outcomes, and qualitatively summarized the main results.
              Results: The majority of the studies focused on anthropometric
              measures and physical activity. Access to respective destinations
              was associated with sports-related physical activity but not with
              body composition. Also, people living in urban structures tended
              to show more health-adverse behaviors such as smoking and
              drinking. Some evidence indicated that higher levels of noise and
              air pollution were related to higher blood pressure levels. No
              association was observed between green spaces or street design

              relationships using a sound theoretical basis and research

              that a standard environmental intervention to increase activity
              among children may not equally benefit boys and girls. METHODS:
              The System for Observation Play and Recreation in Communities was
              used to measure physical activity among 2,712 children and
              adolescents in 20 neighborhood parks in Durham, North Carolina,
              in 2007. Sedentary activity, walking, vigorous park activity, and
              energy expenditure were the primary outcome variables.
              Hierarchical logit regression models of physical activity were
              estimated separately for boys and girls. RESULTS: Type of
              activity area and presence of other active children were
              positively associated with boys' and girls' physical activity,
              and presence of a parent was negatively associated. A significant
              interaction involving number of recreation facilities in
              combination with formal activities was positively associated with
              girls' activity. A significant interaction involving formal park
              activity and young boys (aged 0-5 y) was negatively associated
              with park-based physical activity. CONCLUSION: Activity area and
              social correlates of park-based physical activity were similar
              for boys and girls; findings for formal park programming, age,
              and number of facilities were mixed. Results show that girls'
              physical activity was more strongly affected by social effects
              (eg, presence of other active children) whereas boys' physical
              activity was more strongly influenced by the availability of park
              facilities. These results can inform park planning and design.
              Additional studies are necessary to clarify sex differences in

              activity and sedentary behaviour in young people, considering the
              methodological quality of the studies. METHODS: Prospective
              studies were identified from searches in PubMed and PsycINFO,
              from April 2004 through November 2010. The authors included
              studies investigating the association between determinants of
              overall physical (in)activity and/or sedentary behaviour in
              healthy children or adolescents. When a determinant was
              investigated for its association with physical (in)activity and
              sedentary behaviour assessed between ages of 4-12, or mean age
              12, it was classified as 'adolescent determinant'. Included
              articles were scored on their methodological quality and a
              best-evidence synthesis was applied to summarise the results.
              RESULTS: The authors identified 30 papers, of which seven were of
              high methodological quality. Intention was found as a determinant
              of children's physical activity. Determinants of adolescents'
              physical activity were age (ie, older children were more active),
              ethnicity (ie, being of African--American descent determined
              being less physically active) and planning. The authors found
              insufficient evidence for determinants of sedentary behaviour.
              CONCLUSION: Studies on determinants of physical activity and
              sedentary behaviour were in general of poor methodological
              quality. To develop long-term effective interventions that
              increase physical activity and decrease time spent in sedentary
              behaviours in young people, we need more high quality prospective
              evidence on the determinants of these behaviours.",

              1345 parental questionnaires from children out of three age

              data using a geographic information system (GIS). RESULTS:
              GIS-derived main street density in a buffer of 100 m around the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: To develop evidence-based interventions promoting
              healthy active lifestyles among young children and their parents,
              a greater understanding is needed of the correlates of physical
              activity and screen time in these dyads. Physical environment
              features within neighborhoods may have important influences on
              both children and their parents. The purpose of this study was to
              examine the associations between several features of the physical
              environment with physical activity and screen time among 511
              young children ($\leq$5 years old) and their parents, after
              adjusting for socio-demographic factors. METHODS: From May to
              September, 2011, parents of 0-5 year old children from Kingston,
              Canada completed a questionnaire that assessed socio-demographic
              characteristics, their physical activity and screen time, and
              their child's physical activity and screen time. Guided by a
              previously developed conceptual framework, several physical
              environment features were assessed using Geographic Information
              Systems including, function (walkability), safety (road speed),
              aesthetics (streetscape), and destination (outdoor play/activity
              space, recreation facilities, distance to closest park, yard at
              home). Multilevel linear regression analyses were used to examine
              the relationships while adjusting for several socio-demographic
              factors. RESULTS: The only independent association observed for
              the physical environment features was between higher outdoor
              play/activity space and higher screen time levels among parents.
              Several associations were observed with socio-demographic
              variables. For physical activity, child age, child care status,
              and family socioeconomic status (SES) were independent correlates
              for children while sex was an independent correlate for parents.
              For screen time, child age and family SES were independent
              correlates for children while neighborhood SES was an independent
              correlate for parents. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that
              socio-demographic factors, including social environment factors,
              may be more important targets than features of the physical
              environment for future interventions aiming to promote healthy
              active lifestyles in young children and their parents. Given this
              was one of the first studies to examine these associations in
              young child-parent dyads, future research should confirm and

              alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use among a diverse sample of
              approximately 5,500 seventh and eighth graders. We also evaluated
              the extent to which individual, family, and school factors
              mediated racial/ ethnic disparities in use. METHOD: Students
              (49\% male) from 16 participating middle schools in southern
              California reported on lifetime and past-month substance use,
              individual factors (expectancies and resistance self-efficacy),
              family factors (familism, parental respect, and adult and older
              sibling use), and school factors (school-grade use and perceived
              peer use). We used generalized estimating equations to examine
              the odds of consumption for each racial/ethnic group adjusting
              for sex, grade, and family structure. Path analysis models tested
              mediation of racial/ethnic differences through individual,
              family, and school factors. RESULTS: After adjusting for sex,
              grade, and family structure, Hispanics reported higher and Asians
              reported lower lifetime and past-month substance use, compared
              with non-Hispanic Caucasians. Rates of substance use did not
              differ between non-Hispanic African Americans and Caucasians.
              Several individual factors mediated the relationship between
              Hispanic ethnicity and substance use, including negative
              expectancies and resistance self-efficacy. Higher use among
              Hispanics was generally not explained by family or school
              factors. By contrast, several factors mediated the relationship
              between Asian race and lower alcohol use, including individual,
              family (parental respect, adult and older sibling use), and
              school (perceived peer use, school-grade use) factors.
              CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the importance of targeting
              specific individual, family, and school factors in tailored
              intervention efforts to reduce substance use among young minority
              adolescents.",

              whether adolescents who engage in risky behavior differ in risk
              perceptions from those who do not. We proposed that risk
              differences between risk-involved and risk-uninvolved adolescents
              depend on how risk questions are framed. High school and college
              students estimated their risk of smoking and unprotected sex by
              replying to four different questions. The results revealed that,
              for both high school and college students, smokers saw their
              outcome risk (risk of negative outcomes) as higher than that of
              nonsmokers. A similar finding was obtained for sexual behavior,
              though only for high school students. No significant differences
              between risk groups were obtained when risk was measured by
              asking about behavior risk (general riskiness of the behavior).
              Overall, the data suggest that adolescents engaged in risky
              behavior do not have a complete appreciation of their exposure to
              harm. Programs intended to prevent or reduce risky behavior need

              highly prevalent, and its symptoms often represent a significant
              public health problem; thus, the aim of this study was to verify
              emergency situations caused by certain comorbidities, or by
              exposing the patient to a higher risk of accidents. DATA SOURCE:
              A literature search was carried out in the PubMed database
              between the years 1992 and 2012, using the key words ``adhd'',
              ``urgency'', ``comorbidity'', ``substance disorder'',
              ``alcohol'', ``eating disorder'', ``suicide'', ``trauma'',
              ``abuse'', ``crime'', ``internet'', ``videogame'', ``bullying'',
              and their combinations. The selection considered the most
              relevant articles according to the scope of the proposed topic,
              performed in a non-systematic way. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several
              situations were observed in which ADHD is the most relevant
              psychiatric diagnosis in relation to its urgency, such as the
              risk of accidents, suicide risk and addition, exposure to
              violence, or risk of internet abuse or sexual abuse; or when ADHD
              is the most prevalent comorbidity and is also correlated with
              emergency situations, such as in bipolar and eating disorders.

  abstract = "CONTEXT: The onset of cigarette smoking typically occurs during
              childhood or early adolescence. Nicotine dependence symptoms can
              manifest soon after onset, contributing to sustained, long-term
              smoking. Previous reviews have not clarified the determinants of
              onset. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In 2015, a systematic review of the
              literature in PubMed and EMBASE was undertaken to identify
              peer-reviewed prospective longitudinal studies published between
              January 1984 and August 2015 that investigated predictors of
              cigarette smoking onset among youth aged <18 years who had never
              smoked. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Ninety-eight conceptually different
              potential predictors were identified in 53 studies. An increased
              risk of smoking onset was consistently (i.e., in four or more
              studies) associated with increased age/grade, lower SES, poor
              academic performance, sensation seeking or rebelliousness,
              intention to smoke in the future, receptivity to tobacco
              promotion efforts, susceptibility to smoking, family members'
              smoking, having friends who smoke, and exposure to films, whereas
              higher self-esteem and high parental monitoring/supervision of
              the child appeared to protect against smoking onset. Methodologic
              weaknesses were identified in numerous studies, including failure
              to account for attrition or for clustering in samples, and
              misidentification of potential confounders, which may have led to
              biased estimates of associations. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of
              smoking onset for which there is robust evidence should be
              considered in the design of interventions to prevent first puff
              in order to optimize their effectiveness. Future research should
              seek to define onset clearly as the transition from never use to
              first use (e.g., first few puffs).Copyright \copyright{} 2016

              of children from two elementary schools were surveyed to assess
              their child's physical activity and barriers to being active.
              Three hundred and forty surveys were returned out of 1,047 for a
              response rate of 32\%. On school days, 41\% of caregivers
              reported that their children spent more than 2 h watching
              television, playing video games, or spending time on the
              computer. While over half of respondents reported that their
              children get more than 2 h of physical activity on school days,
              14\% of children were reported to be physically active less than
              1 h per day. Caregivers identified violence, cost of

              examined the prospective associations between parent involvement,
              sibling companionship, and adolescent substance use at 2 points
              in mid- and late-adolescence. Adolescents were adopted (n = 568)
              or the biological offspring of both parents (n = 412).
              Cross-lagged panel results showed that higher levels of parent
              involvement in early adolescence were associated with lower
              levels of substance use later in adolescence. Results did not
              significantly differ across adoption status, suggesting this
              association cannot be due to passive gene-environment
              correlation. Adolescent substance use at Time 1 was not
              significantly associated with parent involvement at Time 2,
              suggesting this association does not appear to be solely due to
              evocative (i.e., ``child-driven'') effects either. Together,
              results support a protective influence of parent involvement on
              subsequent adolescent substance use that is environmental in
              nature. The cross-paths between sibling companionship and

              direction (i.e., protective) for sisters, but positive for
              brothers (in line with a social contagion hypothesis). These
              effects were consistent across genetically related and unrelated
              pairs, and thus appear to be environmentally mediated. For mixed
              gender siblings, results were consistent with environmentally
              driven, protective influence hypothesis for genetically unrelated
              pairs, but in line with a genetically influenced, social

              recess. The aim of this study was to explore children's
              perspectives (i.e., child-identified determinants) of
              activity-friendly school playgrounds. We conducted participatory
              research with children as co-researchers, framed as a project to
              give children the opportunity to discuss their views and ideas
              about their school playgrounds. At three schools, six children
              (9-12 years old) met over five to seven group meetings. Data
              analysis included children's conclusions obtained during the
              project and the researcher's analysis of written reports of all
              meetings. Children indicated a strong desire for fun and active
              play, with physical playground characteristics and safety, rules
              and supervision, peer-interactions, and variation in
              equipment/games as important determinants. Our results indicate
              that improving activity-friendliness of playgrounds requires an
              integrated and multi-faceted approach. It also indicates that
              children, as primary users, are able to identify barriers for
              active play that are easily overlooked, unknown or differently
              perceived by adults. Hence, we believe that structural
              involvement of children in designing, developing and improving
              playgrounds may increase children's' active play and consequently
              PA levels during recess.",

              smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana use during young adulthood.
              METHOD: Data were obtained from the national Panel Study of
              Income Dynamics, a survey of U.S. families that incorporates data
              from parents and their children. In 2005 and 2007, the Panel
              Study of Income Dynamics was supplemented with two waves of
              Transition into Adulthood data drawn from a national sample of
              young adults, 18-23 years old. Data from the young adults (N =
              1,203; 66.1\% White; 51.5\% female) on their current use of
              alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana were used as outcome variables
              in logistic regressions. Socioeconomic background was calculated
              from parental reports of education, wealth, and income during the
              respondent's childhood (birth through age 17 years). RESULTS:
              Smoking in young adulthood was associated with lower childhood
              family SES, although the association was explained by demographic
              and social role covariates. Alcohol use and marijuana use in
              young adulthood were associated with higher childhood family SES,
              even after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
              based on three indicators of family background SES--income,
              wealth, and parental education--converged in describing unique
              patterns for smoking and for alcohol and marijuana use among
              young adults, although functional relationships across SES
              measures varied. Young adults with the highest family background

              from the 2007-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
              were used to determine prevalence of cigarette smoking and
              obesity by disability status, further stratified by race and

              ethnicity ranged from 10.1 \% of Asian adults to 31.0 \% of
              American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) adults. Smoking prevalence

              among children and adolescents were included. Forty-seven
              articles were identified, including eight longitudinal and 41
              cross-sectional studies conducted in eight countries. The sample
              size ranged from 88 to 46 813. Street intersection density (SID),
              measured by Geographic Information Systems in 36 studies and
              reported in 13 studies, was the main indicator used to represent
              street connectivity. Forty-four studies examined the association
              between SID and weight-related behaviours, including overall PA
              (n = 15), moderate-to-vigorous PA (n = 13), active transport (n =
              12), dog walking (n = 1), walking (n = 1), sedentary behaviours
              (n = 2), and TV viewing (n = 1). Fifteen studies focused on the
              association between SID and weight-related outcomes. Overall,
              evidence from this systematic review and meta-analyses suggested
              a positive association between street connectivity and PA.
              However, it was difficult to draw a conclusion on the association
              between street connectivity and BMI. More longitudinal evidence
              is needed to confirm the causal association between street
              connectivity and weight status.",

              represent a significant burden to children and youth, few studies
              have examined the descriptive epidemiology of sports-related
              injury since 2005, and some sports such as ringette have not been
              evaluated to date. The primary purpose of this study was to
              provide the descriptive epidemiology of sports-related injuries
              treated in emergency departments for children and youth aged 5 -
              19. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis was performed using
              data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention
              Program [CHIRPP] from fiscal years (April - March) 2007/08 to
              2009/10. CHIRPP is a computerized information system designed by
              the Public Health Agency of Canada that collects information
              about injuries to people evaluated in emergency departments
              across 11 pediatric hospitals and 5 general hospitals in Canada.
              Thirteen sports or activities were analyzed (baseball,
              basketball, cycling, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, ringette,
              rugby, skiing, sledding, snowboarding, soccer, and volleyball).
              Descriptive statistics, including frequency by sport, age and
              sex, as well as the percent of concussions within each sport were
              calculated. RESULTS: Out of a total of 56, 691 reported sports
              and recreational injuries, soccer accounted for the largest
              proportion of injuries with 11,941 reported cases over the 3 year
              time period. Of these, approximately 30\% were fractures. The 10
              - 14 year age group reported the greatest proportion of injuries
              in 10 out of the 13 sports analyzed. In addition, males reported
              a greater number of overall injuries than females in 11 out of
              the 13 sports analyzed. The largest percentage of concussions was
              reported in ringette; these injuries accounted for 17.1\% of
              overall injuries within this sport. CONCLUSIONS: Injury
              prevention programs in Canada should focus on improving

              number of different characteristics were related to the different
              injury outcomes. Childhood accident injuries were related to
              measures female headed households, adult to child ratio, and

              of copying from previous notes in the record and pasting into a
              new note. Previous work has shown that this redundancy has a
              negative impact on the quality of text mining and topic modeling
              in particular. In this paper we describe a novel variant of
              Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, Red-LDA, which
              takes into account the inherent redundancy of patient records
              when modeling content of clinical notes. To assess the value of
              Red-LDA, we experiment with three baselines and our novel
              redundancy-aware topic modeling method: given a large collection
              of patient records, (i) apply vanilla LDA to all documents in all
              input records; (ii) identify and remove all redundancy by chosing
              a single representative document for each record as input to LDA;
              (iii) identify and remove all redundant paragraphs in each
              record, leaving partial, non-redundant documents as input to LDA;
              and (iv) apply Red-LDA to all documents in all input records.

              on held-out data and topic coherence of produced topics and

              that Red-LDA produces superior models to all three baseline

              behaviours among adults, including associated socio-demographic
              variables. Method A literature search was conducted in May 2014.
              Studies examining at least two SNAP risk factors, and using a
              cluster or factor analysis technique, or comparing observed to
              expected prevalence of risk factor combinations, were included.
              Results Fifty-six relevant studies were identified. A majority of
              studies (81\%) reported a `healthy' cluster characterised by the
              absence of any SNAP risk factors. More than half of the studies
              reported a clustering of alcohol with smoking, and half reported

              This study compared the role of maternal and paternal supervision

              METHODS: Mothers (n = 170) of toddlers were interviewed for 6
              months about their children's unintentional injuries. RESULTS:
              Children were more likely to engage in high activity levels and
              were at higher risk for injury when being cared for by their
              fathers. Although higher supervision predicted lower injury risk

              the built environment with youth moderate-vigorous activity,
              including walking. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Embase, and
              Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)
              databases were searched using relevant key words for articles
              published between January 2000 and March 2013. STUDY SELECTION:
              The included articles reported associations between children's or

              residential neighbourhoods or activity settings defined with
              geographical information systems (GIS), street audits or global
              positioning systems (GPS). Excluded articles did not delineate
              neighbourhoods by residential address or were not written in
              English. Of 320 potentially relevant articles, 31 met the
              inclusion criteria, but only 23 (with a total of 6,175
              participants, aged 8-17 years) provided sufficient data to derive
              effects (associations) of built-environment features on child or
              adolescent habitual moderate-vigorous activity. STUDY APPRAISAL
              AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Ten criteria were used to appraise the
              inclusion of studies. The effects were analysed as the difference
              in mean minutes of daily moderate-vigorous activity either
              between two levels of a dichotomous variable (e.g., neighbourhood
              park available or not within 800 m) or between predicted means
              corresponding to a difference of two standard deviations of a
              simple linear numeric variable (e.g., housing density per square
              kilometre). The magnitude of the difference in means was
              evaluated via standardization. The meta-analysis was performed
              with the 14 studies using GIS or street audits to relate a total
              of 58 specific built-environment features to daily activity. Each
              feature was categorized with two dichotomous variables to
              indicate whether the feature promoted playing and/or walking, and
              these variables were included in the meta-analytic model as
              moderators interacting with age and proportion of males in the
              study as linear numeric covariates. RESULTS: The meta-analysed
              effects of built-environment features that encourage play
              (including sports and fitness) and/or walking on youth
              moderate-vigorous activity ranged between trivial and small.
              There was a moderate effect of age (15 versus 9 years) whereby
              play facilities, parks, playgrounds and features that facilitate
              walking had negative effects on children's activity but positive
              effects on adolescents' activity. In studies that located youth
              physical activity with GPS, walking to school produced small
              increases in activity compared with transport by car or bus,
              greater proportions of activity took place in streets and urban
              venues (40-80\%) than in green spaces (20-50\%), and more than
              half of children's outdoor activity occurred with a parent
              nearby. LIMITATIONS: The meta-analysis cannot quantify the
              additive effect when several built-environment features are
              provided in a given neighbourhood. CONCLUSIONS: Children do not
              benefit to the same extent as adolescents from built-environment
              features that encourage walking and those designed or used for
              neighbourhood play.",

              underlying causal structure is unknown and only limited knowledge
              is available. We assume all covariates being considered are
              pretreatment variables and that for each covariate it is known
              (i) whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and (ii)
              whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome. The causal
              relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed
              unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that
              is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show
              that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if
              any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for
              confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion
              will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria
              for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal
              theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the
              application of the result does not rely on familiarity with
              causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, ``Is the
              covariate a cause of the treatment?'' and ``Is the covariate a
              cause of the outcome?'' If the answer to either question is
              ``yes'' then the covariate is included for confounder control. We
              discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve
              unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when used with our

              their physical, health, and emotional development. The prevalence
              of health risk behavior (HRB) in Czech youth such as smoking,
              drug and alcohol use is the highest in Europe. AIM: To analyze
              differences in HRB in youth residents within different types of
              Prague's neighborhoods in relation to the perception of the built
              environment, quality of their school and home environments. DATA
              AND METHODS: The data is based on the on-line survey among
              elementary school students aged between 14-15 years, which was
              administered in19 selected schools in Prague, during the months
              of October 2013 to March 2014. Respondents were asked their
              opinions on various issues related to their HRB, about their
              indoor and outdoor housing and school environments. The
              questionnaire was completed by 407 students. Factor analysis with
              a principal components extraction was applied to determine the
              underlying structure in the variables. A consequent field
              research was conducted to map the opportunity hot spots and
              critical places around the elementary schools. RESULTS: Binge
              drinking has been reported mainly by the students living in the
              housing estates with blocks of flats. The most frequent
              occurrence of daily smokers was found in the neighborhoods of old
              city apartment houses. High prevalence of risky marijuana use
              almost in all the surveyed types of neighborhoods. The
              respondents were more critical in their evaluation of school
              characteristics. The neighborhoods critically evaluated by the
              students as regards the school outdoor environments were the
              older apartment houses in the historical centre and inner city,
              the school indoor environment was worst assessed within the
              housing estate neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
              that perceptions of problems in both residential and school
              environment are associated with HRB. This fact makes this issue
              of a serious importance also from the policy point of view.

              and neighborhood environment among children of different age
              groups. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were derived from 6470
              parents of children from 42 primary schools in four Dutch cities
              by means of questionnaires (2007-2008). Multivariate sequential
              Poisson GEE analyses were conducted (2010) to quantify the
              correlation between physical and social home and neighborhood
              characteristics and outdoor play among boys and girls aged 4-6
              years, 7-9 years, and 10-12 years. RESULTS: This study showed

              to outdoor play in five of six subgroups (RR=1.01-1.02), whereas
              physical neighborhood characteristics (e.g., green neighborhood

              with outdoor play in specific subgroups only. CONCLUSIONS:
              Neighborhood social cohesion was related to outdoor play among
              children of different age and gender, which makes it a promising
              point of action for policy development. Policies aimed at
              improving physical neighborhood characteristics in relation to

              health risks, and social implications and how those perceptions
              differ between ST users and never-users. Semi-structured
              individual interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of
              55 male students (32 ST ever-users) at three rural California
              high schools. Interviews were audio recorded and professionally

              ST-related perceptions, including: that ST is a common, normative
              way of life in rural ``country'' culture among certain groups;
              that ST use conveys oral health risks; and that the decision to
              use (or not to use) is rooted in personal choice. ST users' and

              severity, and inevitability of health risks, particularly
              relative to cigarette smoking. Other differences included
              perceived parental permissiveness and the expected social
              benefits of ST use, such as peer acceptance and conveying
              maturity. Within this population of rural male adolescents, ST
              users emphasized the social benefits of ST use, while
              acknowledging but discounting health risks. Differences and

              these findings are sensitive to the definition of urban and
              rural. We use three different definitions of urban-rural continua
              to quantify and compare motor vehicle occupant fatality rates per
              person-trip and person-mile for the state of Wisconsin. The three
              urban-rural continua are defined by: (1) popular impressions of
              urban, suburban, and rural places using a system from regional
              economics; (2) population density; and (3) the intensity of

              three definitions captured different people and places within

              this heterogeneity, the three definitions resulted in similar

              articles were identified and two major themes emerged: (i)
              accessible playground environments--features and factors; (ii)
              from excluding to including--making playground environments
              usable. Findings indicate that numerous environmental barriers
              contribute to making playground environments inaccessible and
              unusable for many children, particularly children with
              disabilities. However, playground design is identified as a
              significant factor in enabling inclusion. CONCLUSION:
              Occupational therapists are in an ideal position to advocate for
              children's occupational right to play, by combining knowledge of
              environmental barriers with an understanding of disability and
              specific knowledge of occupation. Through focusing on advocacy
              and change at policy and community levels, therapists can work to
              maximize social inclusion in playground settings.",

              are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes,
              affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead
              to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation
              of marginal structural models have been developed to address this

              methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent
              confounding, to estimate the total effect of an exposure on a
              subsequent outcome by controlling appropriately for prior
              exposures, outcomes, and time-varying covariates. We refer to the

              tobacco (snus) use in a prospective cohort of adolescents.
              DESIGN: A cross sectional analysis of a cohort sub-sample.
              SETTING: County of Stockholm, Sweden. SUBJECTS: 520 adolescents
              in the final grade of junior high school (mean age 15.0 years).
              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Concordance between self reported tobacco
              use and saliva cotinine concentration. RESULTS: Using a cut point
              of 5 ng/ml saliva cotinine to discriminate active tobacco use,
              there was a 98\% concordance between self reported non-use in the
              past month and cotinine concentration. The sensitivity of the
              questionnaire compared to the saliva cotinine test, used as the
              gold standard, was 90\% and the specificity 93\%. One hundred and
              fifteen out of 520 subjects (22\%) reported monthly tobacco use.
              Among these, 67\% (46/69) of the exclusive cigarette smokers,
              82\% (23/28) of exclusive snus users, and 94\% (15/16) of mixed
              users (cigarettes + snus) had cotinine concentrations above 5
              ng/ml. Among subjects reporting daily use 96\% (64/67) had saliva

              questionnaire and cotinine test compared to snus users (odds
              ratio 3.2, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 8.6). CONCLUSION: This
              study confirms the reliability of adolescents' self reported
              tobacco use. In a context of low exposure to environmental
              tobacco smoke a cut off for saliva cotinine of 5 ng/ml reliably
              discriminated tobacco users from non-users. Irregular use of
              tobacco in this age group probably explains the discrepancy
              between self reported use and cotinine concentrations.",

              RESULTS: Three composite indicators emerged from our analysis:
              (1) Overt Risk-Taking (i.e., substance use, caffeinated energy
              drink consumption, fighting, and risky sexual behaviour), (2)
              Aversion to a Healthy Lifestyle (i.e., physical inactivity and

              authors describe basic and clinical data supporting adolescent
              neurodevelopment as a biologically critical period of greater
              vulnerability for experimentation with substances and acquisition
              of substance use disorders. METHOD: The authors reviewed recent
              literature regarding neurocircuitry underlying motivation,
              impulsivity, and addiction, with a focus on studies investigating
              adolescent neurodevelopment. RESULTS: Adolescent neurodevelopment
              occurs in brain regions associated with motivation, impulsivity,
              and addiction. Adolescent impulsivity and/or novelty seeking as a
              transitional trait behavior can be explained in part by
              maturational changes in frontal cortical and subcortical
              monoaminergic systems. These developmental processes may

The etiology of this phenomenon has not been fully explored, and one possible contextual determinant is involvement in sport activities that foster risk-taking behaviors through physical and social mechanisms. Using the 2013-14 Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC) study we therefore examined this hypothesis in a contemporary national sample of Canadian adolescents. The strength and direction of the relationship between sport and substance use varied by gender and substance, with team sport participation associated with increased binge drinking (RR 1.33 [95\% CI 1.13, ��1.56] for boys, RR 1.21 [1.06, ��1.38] for girls) and use of smokeless tobacco (RR 1.68 [1.34, ��2.10] for boys, RR 1.32 [1.01, ��1.72] for girls), but with lower prevalence levels of cannabis use (RR 0.73 [95\% CI 0.61–0.88]) and cigarette smoking (RR 0.79 [95\% CI 0.70–0.89]) in girls alone. We also compared team sport athletes with high social involvement (sports team as primary peer group) and physical involvement (higher number of days/week physically active) to those with low involvement. For boys, the combination of high physical and high social involvement was associated with the highest risk, while high social involvement alone was associated with the greatest risk for girls. While team sport participation confers only a small increased risk for substance use, the prevalence of sport participation results in a large population impact. Given this fact, interventions such as education for parents and coaches and policies encouraging engagement in a variety of extracurricular activities should be explored."

  abstract  = "In recent years, social media has become part of our lives, even
               among children. From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic period,
               media device and Internet access rapidly increased. Adolescents
               connected Internet alone, consulting social media, mostly
               Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. During ``lockdown'', the
               Internet usage allowed communication with peers and the
               continuity activities such as school teaching. However, we have
               to keep in mind that media usage may be related to some adverse
               consequences especially in the most vulnerable people, such as
               the young. Aim of the review is to focus on risks correlated to
               social media use by children and adolescents, identifying spies
               of rising problems and engaging in preventive recommendations.
               The scoping review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines,
               searching on PubMed the terms social media or social
               network, health, and pediatrics. Excluding articles
               not pertinent, we found 68 reports. Out of them, 19 were dealing
               with depression, 15 with diet, and 15 with psychological
               problems, which appeared to be the most reported risk of social
               media use. Other identified associated problems were sleep,
               addiction, anxiety, sex related issues, behavioral problems,
               body image, physical activity, online grooming, sight, headache,
               and dental caries. Public and medical awareness must rise over
               this topic and new prevention measures must be found, starting
               with health practitioners, caregivers, and websites/application
               developers. Pediatricians should be aware of the risks
               associated to a problematic social media use for the young's
               health and identify sentinel signs in children as well as
               prevent negative outcomes in accordance with the family.",
